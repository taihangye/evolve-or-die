<p>每天早上醒来第一个念头是真正让自己醒来，注意互相，注意身体的感受，心里的状态。但现在往往是拿手机，这个和手机放在床边很有关系，需要在新年做一些改变。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The virtues of getting up early have nothing to do with cramming more hours of busyness and industry into one’s day. Just the opposite. They stem from the stillness and solitude of the hour, and the potential to use that time to expand consciousness, to contemplate, to make time for being, for purposefully not doing anything. The peacefulness, the darkness, the dawn, the stillness—all contribute to making early morning a special time for mindfulness practice.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Waking early has the added value of giving you a very real head start on the day. If you can begin your day with a firm foundation in mindfulness and inner peacefulness, then when you do have to get going and start doing, it is much more likely that the doing will flow out of your being. You are more likely to carry a robust mindfulness, an inner calmness and balance of mind with you throughout the day, than had you just jumped out of bed and started in on the call of demands and responsibilities, however pressing and important.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>早期不是为了“做”更多的事，而是把时间留给自己，给自己的身体和心里做好准备，更从容地开始外务。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We all carry around ideas and images of reality, frequently garnered from other people or from courses we have taken, books we have read, or from television, the radio, newspapers, the culture in general, which give us pictures of how things are and what is occurring. As a result, we often see our thoughts, or someone else’s, instead of seeing what is right in front of us or inside of us. Often, we don’t even bother to look or check how we feel because we think we already know and understand. So we can be closed to the wonder and vitality of fresh encounters. If we are not careful, we can even forget that direct contact is possible. We may lose touch with what is basic and not even know it. We can live in a dream reality of our own making without even a sense of the loss, the gulf, the unnecessary distance we place between ourselves and experience. Not knowing this, we can be all the more impoverished, spiritually and emotionally. But something wonderful and unique can occur when our contact with the world becomes direct.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>保持好奇心，同样一件事，都有可能带来不同的感受。人很容易陷入：这事我知道了，而忽略了真正背后的感情、深层的事实等等。</p>
