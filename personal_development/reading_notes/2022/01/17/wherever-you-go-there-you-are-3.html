Let that core start radiating its energy outwardly, through your entire body, and beyond. Experiment with giving away this energy—in little ways at first—directing it toward yourself and toward others with no thought of gain or return. Give more than you think you can, trusting that you are richer than you think. Celebrate this richness. Give as if you had inexhaustible wealth. This is called “kingly giving.” I am not talking solely of money or material possessions, although it can be wonderfully growth-enhancing, uplifting, and truly helpful to share material abundance. Rather, what is being suggested here is that you practice sharing the fullness of your being, your best self, your enthusiasm, your vitality, your spirit, your trust, your openness, above all, your presence. Share it with yourself, with your family, with the world.”" />

<p>传说中的传递正能量。影响自己，影响他人，影响世界。钱和物质上的捐赠并不是重点，通过做更好的自己，分享自己的热爱，活力，精神，信任，开放，是可以从精神层面激励数不清的人的。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Voluntary simplicity means going fewer places in one day rather than more, seeing less so I can see more, doing less so I can do more, acquiring less so I can have more. It all ties in. ”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>做减法其实也是一种加法，少做不同的事，少看不同的东西，其实就可以更多地把时间花在重要的事、东西和自身上。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I practice saying no to keep my life simple, and I find I never do it enough. It’s an arduous discipline all its own, and well worth the effort. Yet it is also tricky. There are needs and opportunities to which one must respond. A commitment to simplicity in the midst of the world is a delicate balancing act. It is always in need of retuning, further inquiry, attention. But I find the notion of voluntary simplicity keeps me mindful of what is important, of an ecology of mind and body and world in which everything is interconnected and every choice has far-reaching consequences. You don’t get to control it all. But choosing simplicity whenever possible adds to life an element of deepest freedom which so easily eludes us, and many opportunities to discover that less may actually be more.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>这作者也说了做减法、说“不”是一门艺术，很多时候会身不由己。当你开始一件事儿的时候，它可能为你的未来带来了无数的责任，而往往很多事的诱惑力又太大，人又不可能完全脱离凡事，所以如何有纪律地取舍真的很重要。</p>
