</blockquote>

<p>想要长期坚持冥想，必须要给自己找到一个自己相信的价值、愿景、方向。这个是可以不断调整的，通过冥想可以了解自己的处境，需要放弃什么，需要在什么方面成长。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Asking yourself why you meditate or why you want to meditate. Don’t believe your first answers. Just write down a list of whatever comes to mind. Continue asking yourself. Also, inquire about your values, about what you honor most in life. Make a list of what is really important to you. Ask yourself: What is my vision, my map for where I am and where I am going? Does this vision reflect my true values and intentions? Am I remembering to embody those values? Do I practice my intentions? How am I now in my job, in my family, in my relationships, with myself? How do I want to be? How might I live my vision, my values? How do I relate to suffering, both my own and others’?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>这段其实和上一段类似。冥想一次很容易，但要长期坚持，并为之找到意义在开始前其实需要想清楚一些事，然后不断通过冥想来审视之前的答案。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The message is that getting caught up in the normal human tendencies of self-cherishing and arrogance, and ignoring the larger order of things, will ultimately lead to an impasse in your life in which you are unable to go forward, unable to go back, and unable to turn around. ”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>自大和无知是非常危险的事，往往会让自己陷入进退失据的局面。就比如，一直呆在一个夕阳产业，而不选择寻找其他出入。</p>
