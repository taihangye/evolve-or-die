## Education
I grew up in China. After graduating from Zhejiang University in Hangzhou (my hometown), I pursued master degree at Cornell University, NY, and graduated in 2016. 
## Work
I took my first job at Oracle, working on Internet of Things Cloud platform (Paas) and enterprise application (Saas). Since 2018, I joined Facebook as a software engineer in WhatsApp Data Infra team mainly focusing on building telemetry collection, AB testing infrastructure. 
## Life
I enjoy reading books. My interests lay in technology (e.g. DL, distributed system), leadership/management, self-improvement (both physically and mentally), investment (I am a believer of index investing). I also picked some topics that are not usually shown in my book list like philosophy, history. 
I also enjoy playing games. My favorite games are no limit texas hold'em, kingdom rush, and Zelda breath of the wild. For the kingdom rush one, I used to run my bilibili [channel](https://space.bilibili.com/544575308), and if you also enjoy this game, check it out!
