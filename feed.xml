Just doing it changes your life. Let that time, whatever its length, be a time of being, a time for intentional wakefulness. You don’t want to fill this time with anything other than awareness. No need to go over the day’s commitments in your head and live “ahead” of yourself. This is a time of no-time, of stillness, of presence, of being with yourself. Also, at the moment of waking up, before getting out of bed, get in touch with your breath, feel the various sensations in your body, note any thoughts and feelings that may be present, let mindfulness touch this moment. Can you feel your breathing? Can you perceive the dawning of each in breath? Can you enjoy the feeling of the breath freely entering your body in this moment? Ask yourself: “Am I awake now?”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Wherever you go there you are - 7</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/personal_development/reading_notes/2022/01/28/wherever-you-go-there-you-are-7.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Wherever you go there you are - 7" /><published>2022-01-28T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2022-01-28T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/personal_development/reading_notes/2022/01/28/wherever-you-go-there-you-are-7</id><author><name></name></author><category term="personal_development" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">“Contemplating “What is my Way?” is an excellent element to inject into our meditation practice. We don’t have to come up with answers, nor think that there has to be one particular answer. Better not to think at all. Instead, only persist in asking the question, letting any answers that formulate just come of themselves and go of themselves. As with everything else in the meditation practice, we just watch, listen, note, let be, let go, and keep generating the question, “What is my Way?”, “What is my path?”, “Who am I?”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Wherever you go there you are - 6</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/personal_development/reading_notes/2022/01/23/wherever-you-go-there-you-are-6.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Wherever you go there you are - 6" /><published>2022-01-23T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2022-01-23T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/personal_development/reading_notes/2022/01/23/wherever-you-go-there-you-are-6</id><author><name></name></author><category term="personal_development" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">“Siddhartha listened. He was now listening intently, completely absorbed, quite empty, taking in everything. He felt that he had now completely learned the art of listening. He had often heard all this before, all these numerous voices in the river, but today they sounded different. He could no longer distinguish the different voices—the merry voice from the weeping voice, the childish voice from the manly voice. They all belonged to each other: the lament of those who yearn, the laughter of the wise, the cry of indignation and the groan of the dying. They were all interwoven and interlocked, entwined in a thousand ways. And all the voices, all the goals, all the pleasures, all the good and evil, all of them together was the world. All of them together was the stream of events, the music of life. When Siddhartha listened attentively to this river, to this song of a thousand voices, when he did not listen to the sorrow or the laughter, when he did not bind his soul to any one particular voice and absorb it in his Self, but heard them all, the whole, the unity, then the great song of a thousand voices consisted of one word.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Wherever you go three you are - 5</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/personal_development/reading_notes/2022/01/17/wherever-you-go-there-you-are-5.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Wherever you go three you are - 5" /><published>2022-01-17T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2022-01-17T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/personal_development/reading_notes/2022/01/17/wherever-you-go-there-you-are-5</id><author><name></name></author><category term="personal_development" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">“Awareness is not the same as thought. It lies beyond thinking, although it makes use of thinking, honoring its value and its power. Awareness is more like a vessel which can hold and contain our thinking, helping us to see and know our thoughts as thoughts rather than getting caught up in them as reality.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Wherever you go three you are - 4</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/personal_development/reading_notes/2022/01/17/wherever-you-go-there-you-are-4.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Wherever you go three you are - 4" /><published>2022-01-17T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2022-01-17T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/personal_development/reading_notes/2022/01/17/wherever-you-go-there-you-are-4</id><author><name></name></author><category term="personal_development" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">“If you hope to bring meditation into your life in any kind of long-term, committed way, you will need a vision that is truly your own—one that is deep and tenacious and that lies close to the core of who you believe yourself to be, what you value in your life, and where you see yourself going. Only the strength of such a dynamic vision and the motivation from which it springs can possibly keep you on this path year in and year out, with a willingness to practice every day and to bring mindfulness to bear on whatever is happening, to open to whatever is perceived, and to let it point to where the holding is and where the letting go and the growing need to happen.”</summary></entry></feed>
