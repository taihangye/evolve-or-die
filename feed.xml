Even the biggest debt crises in history (e.g., the 1930s Great Depression) were gotten past once the right adjustments were made. From my examination of these cases, the biggest risks are not from the debts themselves but from a) the failure of policy makers to do the right things, due to a lack of knowledge and/or lack of authority, and b) the political consequences of making adjustments that hurt some people in the process of helping others. It is from a desire to help reduce these risks that I have written this study.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Big Debt Crisis - 1</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/investment/reading_notes/2021/11/25/big-debt-crisis-1.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Big Debt Crisis - 1" /><published>2021-11-25T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2021-11-25T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/investment/reading_notes/2021/11/25/big-debt-crisis-1</id><author><name></name></author><category term="investment" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">Credit is the giving of buying power. This buying power is granted in exchange for a promise to pay it back, which is debt. Clearly, giving the ability to make purchases by providing credit is, in and of itself, a good thing, and not providing the power to buy and do good things can be a bad thing. For example, if there is very little credit provided for development, then there is very little development, which is a bad thing. The problem with debt arises when there is an inability to pay it back. Said differently, the question of whether rapid credit/debt growth is a good or bad thing hinges on what that credit produces and how the debt is repaid (i.e., how the debt is serviced)</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Early Retirement Extreme - A philosophical and practical guide to financial independence - 23</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/investment/fire/reading_notes/2021/11/20/early-retirement-extreme-23.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Early Retirement Extreme - A philosophical and practical guide to financial independence - 23" /><published>2021-11-20T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2021-11-20T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/investment/fire/reading_notes/2021/11/20/early-retirement-extreme-23</id><author><name></name></author><category term="investment" /><category term="FIRE" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">Reward is often correlated with risk, where risk can either be quantified as volatility or qualified as uncertainty (lack of knowledge).

Both of these statements are true, but for different reasons. If you think about a fast race car, it’s a more risky vehicle to drive, but if you know how to drive it, the risk goes down. There are two conclusions from this. First, having a margin of safety in terms of principal is a good idea. In other words, having a low withdrawal rate is safer than a high withdrawal rate, because the required rate of return is lower. A larger fund thus allows for more safety. Second, invest in what you understand rather than what people tell you. This is the main reason I’m not telling you what to invest in.
