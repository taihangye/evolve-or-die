This goes not only for the writing process but also—and especially—for the delivery. Don’t let people skip over the good stuff in order to obsess over the areas for improvement, as many will want to do. Those strengths are what you’ll use to determine when people should be promoted, and it is important to write them down and reflect on them.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The manager’s path - 11</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/management/leadership/reading_notes/2022/05/01/the-manager-path-11.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The manager’s path - 11" /><published>2022-05-01T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-05-01T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/management/leadership/reading_notes/2022/05/01/the-manager-path-11</id><author><name></name></author><category term="management" /><category term="leadership" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">“Sometimes it helps to have a goal, so task yourself with regularly identifying people who deserve praise. Adopting a habit of positive recognition forces you to be on the lookout for things to praise, which in turn causes you to pay attention to what individuals are bringing to various projects. You don’t have to do this in public, but every week there should be at least one thing you can recognize about someone on your team. Even better, look for something to recognize weekly for everyone who reports to you.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">读书日谈读书 有感</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/reading_notes/2022/04/23/%E8%AF%BB%E4%B9%A6%E6%97%A5%E8%B0%88%E8%AF%BB%E4%B9%A6%E6%9C%89%E6%84%9F.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="读书日谈读书 有感" /><published>2022-04-23T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-04-23T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/reading_notes/2022/04/23/%E8%AF%BB%E4%B9%A6%E6%97%A5%E8%B0%88%E8%AF%BB%E4%B9%A6%E6%9C%89%E6%84%9F</id><author><name></name></author><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">《读书日谈读书》是翟东升老师在b站上写的一篇文章，里面谈了他是如何选书、读书以及突破书本身的牢笼的。读下来感觉有不少观点是和我自己的感受有类似的地方的。</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The manager’s path - 9</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/management/leadership/reading_notes/2022/04/23/the-manager-path-9.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The manager’s path - 9" /><published>2022-04-23T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-04-23T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/management/leadership/reading_notes/2022/04/23/the-manager-path-9</id><author><name></name></author><category term="management" /><category term="leadership" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">“How much coaching does this person need?

This is a great approach for ensuring they remain junior managers, and unsuccessful leaders at that. It’s hard to accept that “new manager” is an entry-level job with no seniority on any front, but that’s the best mindset with which to start leading.”</summary></entry></feed>
