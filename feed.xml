Some days you’re on a maker’s schedule, and some days you’re on a manager’s schedule. Through trial and error, you’ll need to learn how to manage your time to provide yourself with appropriately sized blocks to work in. The worst scheduling mistake is allowing yourself to get pulled randomly into meetings. It is very difficult to get into the groove of writing code if you’re interrupted every hour by a meeting.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The manager’s path - 3</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/management/leadership/reading_notes/2022/04/03/the-manager-path-3.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The manager’s path - 3" /><published>2022-04-03T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-04-03T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/management/leadership/reading_notes/2022/04/03/the-manager-path-3</id><author><name></name></author><category term="management" /><category term="leadership" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">“The tech lead role is not a point on the ladder, but a set of responsibilities that any engineer may take on once they reach the senior level. This role may or may not include people management, but if it does, the tech lead is expected to manage these team members to the high management standards of RTR tech. These standards include: Regular (weekly) 1-1 touchbases Regular feedback on career growth, progression towards goals, areas for improvement, and praise as warranted Working with reports to identify areas for learning and helping them grow in these areas via project work, external learning, or additional mentoring If a tech lead is not managing directly, they are still expected to provide mentorship and guidance to the other members of the team. The tech lead is learning how to be a strong technical project manager, and as such, they are scaling themselves by delegating work effectively without micromanaging. They focus on the whole team’s productivity and strive to increase the impact of the team’s work product. They are empowered to make independent decisions for the team and are learning how to handle difficult management and leadership situations. They are also learning how to partner effectively with product, analytics, and other areas of the business. It is not required that an engineer work as a tech lead to progress, but it is the most common way for engineers to grow from senior engineer 1 -&amp;gt; 2 and is required to grow from senior engineer 2 to engineering lead. Realistically it is very hard to grow past senior engineer 2 without ever having acted as a tech lead, even on the individual contributor track, due to the importance at senior levels of leadership and responsibility.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The manager’s path - 2</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/management/leadership/reading_notes/2022/04/03/the-manager-path-2.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The manager’s path - 2" /><published>2022-04-03T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-04-03T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/management/leadership/reading_notes/2022/04/03/the-manager-path-2</id><author><name></name></author><category term="management" /><category term="leadership" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">“Whatever the source of the mentoring arrangement, common mentoring pitfalls include viewing it as a low-status “emotional labor” position, assuming that “like” must mentor “like,” and failing to use the opportunity to observe potential on your team firsthand. Emotional labor is a way to think about traditionally feminine “soft skills”—that is, skills that address the emotional needs of people and teams. Because the outcome can be hard to quantitatively measure, emotional labor is often dismissed as less important work than writing software. It’s assumed to be something that should just be provided without financial recognition. I’m not suggesting that you should pay people extra money to serve as mentors, but they need to be recognized for the work they put in, and the mentor should be treated as a first-class citizen with respect to other responsibilities the person might have. As I said before, plan for it, and provide the mentor the time to do the job right. You have already invested in creating this mentoring relationship, whether it’s the thousands of dollars and many hours spent on hiring, or the overhead and coordination of creating a mentoring program. It’s worth continuing the investment through to[…]”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The manager’s path - 1</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/management/leadership/reading_notes/2022/04/03/the-manager-path-1.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The manager’s path - 1" /><published>2022-04-03T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-04-03T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/management/leadership/reading_notes/2022/04/03/the-manager-path-1</id><author><name></name></author><category term="management" /><category term="leadership" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">“When you are interested in being promoted, it’s very important to ask your manager for specific areas to focus on in order to get that promotion. Managers usually cannot guarantee promotions, but good managers know what the system is looking for and can help you build those achievements and skills. Again, this only goes so far. At more senior levels of work, opportunities for promotion are much more rare, and your manager may need you to find and propose the achievements that qualify you for the next level.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">禅者的初心 - 9</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/philosophy/reading_notes/2022/03/25/chanzhedechuxin-9.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="禅者的初心 - 9" /><published>2022-03-25T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-03-25T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/philosophy/reading_notes/2022/03/25/chanzhedechuxin-9</id><author><name></name></author><category term="philosophy" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">“无”总是在那里，万物从中涌现。但是通常，我们都会忘了“无”这回事，行为举止就像是我们拥有了“有”。 但如此一来，你做的事就会是基于一些这样的具体观念，因而并不自然。例如，当你在听讲时，不应该有任何自我的观念。你要忘掉自己的想法，只是聆听对方说话。让你的心保持“无”的状态，就是自然，这样你才会明白对方所说的话。 反过来说，如果你用某些观念去跟对方说的话做比较，你就不会全部都听进去。你的了解会是片面的，而这就不是自然的了。你做任何事情时，都应该全心投人，你应该完全奉献向己，这样你就会得到“无”。所以，如果在你的活动中没有空性，它就是不自然的。</summary></entry></feed>
