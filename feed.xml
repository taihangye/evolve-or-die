Instead, we fall into a robotlike way of seeing and thinking and doing. In those moments, we break contact with what is deepest in ourselves and affords us perhaps our greatest opportunities for creativity, learning, and growing. If we are not careful, those clouded moments can stretch out and become most of our lives.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The evolution of cooperation - 10</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/personal_development/reading_notes/2022/01/15/the-evolution-of-cooperation-10.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The evolution of cooperation - 10" /><published>2022-01-15T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2022-01-15T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/personal_development/reading_notes/2022/01/15/the-evolution-of-cooperation-10</id><author><name></name></author><category term="personal_development" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">“A common reaction of someone caught in a Prisoner’s Dilemma is that “there ought to be a law against this sort of thing.” In fact, getting out of Prisoner’s Dilemmas is one of the primary functions of government: to make sure that when individuals do not have private incentives to cooperate, they will be required to do the socially useful thing anyway. Laws are passed to cause people to pay their taxes, not to steal, and to honor contracts with strangers. Each of these activities could be regarded as a giant Prisoner’s Dilemma game with many players. No one wants to pay taxes because the benefits are so diffuse and the costs are so direct. But everyone may be better off if each person has to pay so that each can share the benefits of schools, roads, and other collective goods (Schelling 1973). This is a major part of what Rousseau meant when he said that government’s role is to make sure that each citizen “will be forced to be free”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The evolution of cooperation - 9</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/personal_development/reading_notes/2022/01/07/the-evolution-of-cooperation-9.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The evolution of cooperation - 9" /><published>2022-01-07T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2022-01-07T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/personal_development/reading_notes/2022/01/07/the-evolution-of-cooperation-9</id><author><name></name></author><category term="personal_development" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">“There is yet a third way in which some of the tournament rules are too clever: they employ a probabilistic strategy that is so complex that it cannot be distinguished by the other strategies from a purely random choice. In other words, too much complexity can appear to be total chaos. If you are using a strategy which appears random, then you also appear unresponsive to the other player. If you are unresponsive, then the other player has no incentive to cooperate with you. So being so complex as to be incomprehensible is very dangerous.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The evolution of cooperation - 8</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/personal_development/reading_notes/2022/01/07/the-evolution-of-cooperation-8.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The evolution of cooperation - 8" /><published>2022-01-07T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2022-01-07T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/personal_development/reading_notes/2022/01/07/the-evolution-of-cooperation-8</id><author><name></name></author><category term="personal_development" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">“When the future of the interaction is not important enough relative to immediate gains from defection, then simply waiting for the other to defect is not such a good idea. It is important to bear in mind that TIT FOR TAT is a stable strategy only when the discount parameter, w, is high enough relative to the payoff parameters, R, S, T, and P. In particular, proposition 2 shows that if the discount parameter is not high enough and the other player is using TIT FOR TAT, a player is better off alternating defection and cooperation, or even always defecting. Therefore, if the other player is not likely to be seen again, defecting right away is better than being nice.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The evolution of cooperation - 7</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/personal_development/reading_notes/2022/01/07/the-evolution-of-cooperation-7.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The evolution of cooperation - 7" /><published>2022-01-07T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2022-01-07T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/personal_development/reading_notes/2022/01/07/the-evolution-of-cooperation-7</id><author><name></name></author><category term="personal_development" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">“The chronological story that emerges from this analysis is the following. ALL D is the primeval state and is evolu-tionarily stable. But cooperation based on reciprocity can gain a foothold through two different mechanisms. First, there can be kinship between mutant strategies, giving the genes of the mutants some stake in each other’s success, thereby altering the payoff of the interaction when viewed from the perspective of the gene rather than the individual. A second mechanism to overcome total defection is for the mutant strategies to arrive in a cluster so that they provide a nontrivial proportion of the interactions each has, even if they are so few as to provide a negligible proportion of the interactions which the ALL D individuals have. Then the tournament approach described in chapter 2 demonstrates that once a variety of strategies is present, TIT FOR TAT is an extremely robust one. It does well in a wide range of circumstances and gradually displaces all other strategies in an ecological simulation that contains a great variety of more or less sophisticated decision rules. And if the probability that interaction between two individuals will continue is great enough, then TIT FOR TAT is an extremely robust one. It does well in a wide range of circumstances and gradually displaces all other strategies in an ecological simulation that contains a great variety of more or less sophisticated decision rules. And if the probability that interaction between two individuals will continue is great enough, then TIT FOR TAT is itself evolution-arily stable. Moreover, its stability is especially secure because it can resist the intrusion of whole clusters of mutant strategies. Thus cooperation based on reciprocity can get started in a predominantly noncooperative world, can thrive in a variegated environment, and can defend itself once fully established.”</summary></entry></feed>
