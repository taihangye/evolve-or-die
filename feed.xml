What sets them apart is the time horizon. They’re determined to reach the correct answer in the long run, and they know that means they have to be open to stumbling, backtracking, and rerouting in the short run.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Think Again - gain confident and being wrong with reflection</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/markdown/2021/06/26/think-again-3.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Think Again - gain confident and being wrong with reflection" /><published>2021-06-26T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-06-26T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/markdown/2021/06/26/think-again-3</id><author><name></name></author><category term="markdown" /><summary type="html">Plenty of evidence suggests that confidence is just as often the result of progress as the cause of it.
