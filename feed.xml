It’s natural that employers prefer employees of the latter persuasion, as they can just break goals into smaller goals and hire an employee for each sub-goal. As an individual or a business, the focus should be on the process rather than sub-goals, lest the long-term perspective be lost.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Early Retirement Extreme - A philosophical and practical guide to financial independence - 15</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/investment/fire/reading_notes/2021/10/23/early-retirement-extreme-15.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Early Retirement Extreme - A philosophical and practical guide to financial independence - 15" /><published>2021-10-23T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-10-23T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/investment/fire/reading_notes/2021/10/23/early-retirement-extreme-15</id><author><name></name></author><category term="investment" /><category term="FIRE" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">“This figure shows a complementary way of mapping out the consequences. For those familiar with “fish bone” diagrams, this is the reverse of one. The taken position is a zeroth-order effect and it has first-order effects. Positive effects go over the line. Negative effects go under the line. Each effect also has second-order effects. Positive effects go over the line. Negative effects go under the line. It’s difficult to say if a position that has a weak positive first-order effect with a strong negative second-order effect or a weak negative first-order effect with a strong positive second-order effect is net positive. If this can’t be determined, the behavior is too complicated and should be avoided (see here). Hopefully this won’t be a problem and second-order effects can be ignored. However, sometimes second- and even third-order effects either add up or accumulate undetected for a long time before triggering spectacular event.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Early Retirement Extreme - A philosophical and practical guide to financial independence - 14</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/investment/fire/reading_notes/2021/10/17/early-retirement-extreme-14.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Early Retirement Extreme - A philosophical and practical guide to financial independence - 14" /><published>2021-10-17T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-10-17T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/investment/fire/reading_notes/2021/10/17/early-retirement-extreme-14</id><author><name></name></author><category term="investment" /><category term="FIRE" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">A very common and very good piece of career advice is not to work to earn money but to work to learn new skills, gain new connections, and create new opportunities.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Early Retirement Extreme - A philosophical and practical guide to financial independence - 13</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/investment/fire/reading_notes/2021/10/17/early-retirement-extreme-13.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Early Retirement Extreme - A philosophical and practical guide to financial independence - 13" /><published>2021-10-17T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-10-17T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/investment/fire/reading_notes/2021/10/17/early-retirement-extreme-13</id><author><name></name></author><category term="investment" /><category term="FIRE" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">“It’s important to understand that doing the right thing (good strategy) is much more important than doing things right (good tactics).”</summary></entry></feed>
