Performance in a realignment may be better than expected, but still poor. Or it may be that nothing much seems to happen, because a crisis was avoided. Sustaining-success situations pose similar problems. Success may consist of a small loss of market share in the face of a concerted attack by competitors or the eking out of a few percentage points of top-line growth in a mature business. The unknown in both realignments and sustaining-success situations is what would have happened if other actions had been taken or other people had been in charge—the “as compared to what?” problem. Measuring success in such situations takes much more work, because to assess the adequacy of their responses, you must have a deep understanding of the challenges new leaders face and the actions they are taking. ”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The First 90 days, Updated and Expanded - Proven strategies for getting up to speed faster and smarter - 9</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/leadership/reading_notes/2022/02/27/the-first-90-days-9.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The First 90 days, Updated and Expanded - Proven strategies for getting up to speed faster and smarter - 9" /><published>2022-02-27T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2022-02-27T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/leadership/reading_notes/2022/02/27/the-first-90-days-9</id><author><name></name></author><category term="leadership" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">“A baseline question you always should ask is, “How did we get to this point?” Otherwise, you risk tearing down existing structures or processes without knowing why they were put there in the first place. Armed with insight into the organization’s history, you may indeed decide that things need to change. Or you may find there is a good reason to leave it exactly where it is. A related learning block, as mentioned in the introduction, is the action imperative. The primary symptom is a nearly compulsive need to take action. Effective leaders strike the right balance between doing (making things happen) and being (observing and reflecting). But it is challenging, as Chris Hadley found, to let yourself “be” during transitions. And the pressure to “do” almost always comes more from inside the leader than from outside forces; it reflects a lack of confidence and a consequent need to prove yourself. Remember: simply displaying a genuine desire to learn and understand translates into increased credibility and influence.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The First 90 days, Updated and Expanded - Proven strategies for getting up to speed faster and smarter - 8</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/leadership/reading_notes/2022/02/25/the-first-90-days-8.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The First 90 days, Updated and Expanded - Proven strategies for getting up to speed faster and smarter - 8" /><published>2022-02-25T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2022-02-25T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/leadership/reading_notes/2022/02/25/the-first-90-days-8</id><author><name></name></author><category term="leadership" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">“Preparing yourself for a new role calls for proactively restructuring your advice-and-counsel network. Early in your career, there is a premium on cultivating good technical advisers—experts in certain aspects of marketing or finance, for instance, who can help you get your work done. As you move to higher levels, however, it becomes increasingly important to get good political counsel and personal advice. Political counselors help you understand the politics of the organization, an understanding that is especially important when you plan to implement change. Personal advisers help you keep perspective and equilibrium in times of stress. Transforming your advice-and-counsel network is never easy; your current advisers may be close friends, and you may feel comfortable with technical advisers whose domains you know well. But it is essential to step back and recognize where you need to build your networks to compensate for blind spots and gaps in your own expertise or experience.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The First 90 days, Updated and Expanded - Proven strategies for getting up to speed faster and smarter - 7</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/leadership/reading_notes/2022/02/23/the-first-90-days-7.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The First 90 days, Updated and Expanded - Proven strategies for getting up to speed faster and smarter - 7" /><published>2022-02-23T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2022-02-23T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/leadership/reading_notes/2022/02/23/the-first-90-days-7</id><author><name></name></author><category term="leadership" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">“They attribute the high failure rate of outside hires to several barriers, notably the following: Leaders from outside the company are not familiar with informal networks of information and communication. Outside hires are not familiar with the corporate culture and therefore have greater difficulty navigating. New people are unknown to the organization and therefore do not have the same credibility as someone who is promoted from within. A long tradition of hiring from within makes it difficult for some organizations to accept outsiders. To overcome these barriers and succeed in joining a new company, you should focus on four pillars of effective onboarding: business orientation, stakeholder connection, alignment of expectations, and cultural adaptation.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The First 90 days, Updated and Expanded - Proven strategies for getting up to speed faster and smarter - 6</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/leadership/reading_notes/2022/02/19/the-first-90-days-6.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The First 90 days, Updated and Expanded - Proven strategies for getting up to speed faster and smarter - 6" /><published>2022-02-19T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2022-02-19T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/leadership/reading_notes/2022/02/19/the-first-90-days-6</id><author><name></name></author><category term="leadership" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">“Decision making becomes more political—less about authority, and more about influence. That isn’t good or bad; it’s simply inevitable. There are two major reasons this is so. First, the issues you’re dealing with become much more complex and ambiguous when you move up a level—and your ability to identify “right” answers based solely on data and analysis declines correspondingly. Decisions are shaped more by others’ expert judgments and who trusts whom, as well as by networks of mutual support. Second, at a higher level of the organization, the other players are more capable and have stronger egos. Remember, you were promoted because you are able and driven; the same is true for everyone around you. So it shouldn’t come as a surprise that the decision-making game becomes much more bruising and politically charged the higher up you go. It’s critical, then, for you to become more effective at building and sustaining alliances.”</summary></entry></feed>
