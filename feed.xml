Financial assets are claims on them. In other words, holders of investments/assets (i.e., capitalists-investors) believe that they can convert their holdings into purchasing power to get goods and services. At the same time, workers expect to be able to exchange a unit’s worth of their contribution to the production of goods and services into buying power for goods and services. But since debt/money/ currency have no intrinsic value, the claims on them are greater than the value of what they are supposed to be able to buy, so they have to be devalued or restructured. In other words, when there are too many debt liabilities/ assets, they either have to be reduced via debt restructurings or monetized. Policy makers tend to use monetization at this stage primarily because it is stimulative rather than contractionary. But monetization simply swaps one IOU (debt) for another (newly printed money). The situation is analogous to a Ponzi scheme. Since there aren’t enough goods and services likely to be produced to back up all the IOUs, there’s a worry that people may not be willing to work in return for IOUs forever.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Big Debt Crisis - 7</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/investment/reading_notes/2021/12/08/big-debt-crisis-7.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Big Debt Crisis - 7" /><published>2021-12-08T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2021-12-08T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/investment/reading_notes/2021/12/08/big-debt-crisis-7</id><author><name></name></author><category term="investment" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">Monetary Policy 1 Interest-rate driven monetary policy (which I’ll call Monetary Policy 1) is the most effective because it has the broadest impact on the economy. When central banks reduce interest rates, they stimulate the economy by a) producing a positive wealth effect (because the lower interest rate raises the present value of most investments); b) making it easier to buy items on credit (because the monthly payments decline), raising demand—especially for interest-rate-sensitive items like durable goods and housing; and c) reducing debt-service burdens (which improves cash flows and spending). MP1 is typically the first approach to a debt crisis, but when short-term interest rates hit around 0 percent, it no longer works effectively, so central banks must go to the second type.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Big Debt Crisis - 6</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/investment/reading_notes/2021/11/28/big-debt-crisis-6.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Big Debt Crisis - 6" /><published>2021-11-28T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2021-11-28T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/investment/reading_notes/2021/11/28/big-debt-crisis-6</id><author><name></name></author><category term="investment" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">There are two main ways in which failed lenders’ assets or existing lenders’ bad assets are managed: They are either a) transferred to a separate entity (an AMC) to manage the restructuring and asset disposal (about 40 percent of the cases studied) or b) they remain on the balance sheet of the original lending institution to manage (about 60 percent of cases). And there are several main levers for disposing of the nonperforming loans: a) restruc turing (e.g., working out the loans through extended terms), b) debt-for-equity swaps and asset seizures, c) direct sales of the loans or assets to third parties, and d) securitizations.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Big Debt Crisis - 5</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/investment/reading_notes/2021/11/27/big-debt-crisis-5.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Big Debt Crisis - 5" /><published>2021-11-27T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2021-11-27T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/investment/reading_notes/2021/11/27/big-debt-crisis-5</id><author><name></name></author><category term="investment" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">Typically, in the early stages of the top, the rise in short rates narrows or eliminates the spread with long rates (i.e., the extra interest rate earned for lending long term rather than short term), lessening the incentive to lend relative to the incentive to hold cash. As a result of the yield curve being flat or inverted (i.e., long-term interest rates are at their lowest relative to short-term interest rates), people are incentivized to move to cash just before the bubble pops, slowing credit growth and causing the previously described dynamic. Unemployment is normally at cyclical lows and inflation rates are rising. The increase in short-term interest rates makes holding cash more attractive, and it raises the interest rate used to discount the future cash flows of assets, weakening riskier asset prices and slowing lending. It also makes items bought on credit de facto more expensive, slowing demand. Short rates typically peak just a few months before the top in the stock market.</summary></entry></feed>
