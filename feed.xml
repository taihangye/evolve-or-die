Then they took so much risk in the quest for more that they managed to lose everything—in 1998, in the middle of the greatest bull market and strongest economy in history. Warren Buffett later put it:  To make money they didn’t have and didn’t need, they risked what they did have and did need. And that’s foolish. It is just plain foolish. If you risk something that is important to you for something that is unimportant to you, it just does not make any sense.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Psychology of Money - Timeless lesson of Wealth, Greed, and Happiness - Luck &amp;amp; Risk</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/investment/reading_notes/2021/08/15/the-psychology-of-money-2.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Psychology of Money - Timeless lesson of Wealth, Greed, and Happiness - Luck &amp;amp; Risk" /><published>2021-08-15T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-08-15T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/investment/reading_notes/2021/08/15/the-psychology-of-money-2</id><author><name></name></author><category term="investment" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">“Luck and risk are both the reality that every outcome in life is guided by forces other than individual effort. They are so similar that you can’t believe in one without equally respecting the other. They both happen because the world is too complex to allow 100% of your actions to dictate 100% of your outcomes. They are driven by the same thing: You are one person in a game with seven billion other people and infinite moving parts. The accidental impact of actions outside of your control can be more consequential than the ones you consciously take.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Psychology of Money - Timeless lesson of Wealth, Greed, and Happiness - No one’s crazy</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/investment/reading_notes/2021/08/15/the-psychology-of-money-1.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Psychology of Money - Timeless lesson of Wealth, Greed, and Happiness - No one’s crazy" /><published>2021-08-15T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-08-15T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/investment/reading_notes/2021/08/15/the-psychology-of-money-1</id><author><name></name></author><category term="investment" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">“Studying history makes you feel like you understand something.
