Many new leaders just play the game, reactively taking their situation as given—and failing as a result. The alternative is to shape the game by negotiating with your boss to establish realistic expectations, reach consensus, and secure sufficient resources.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The First 90 days, Updated and Expanded - Proven strategies for getting up to speed faster and smarter - 11</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/leadership/reading_notes/2022/03/05/the-first-90-days-11.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The First 90 days, Updated and Expanded - Proven strategies for getting up to speed faster and smarter - 11" /><published>2022-03-05T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2022-03-05T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/leadership/reading_notes/2022/03/05/the-first-90-days-11</id><author><name></name></author><category term="leadership" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">“Whether any leader in transition can adapt her personal leadership strategy successfully depends greatly on the ability to embrace the following pillars of self-management: enhancing self-awareness, exercising personal discipline, and building complementary teams.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The First 90 days, Updated and Expanded - Proven strategies for getting up to speed faster and smarter - 10</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/leadership/reading_notes/2022/03/05/the-first-90-days-10.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The First 90 days, Updated and Expanded - Proven strategies for getting up to speed faster and smarter - 10" /><published>2022-03-05T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2022-03-05T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/leadership/reading_notes/2022/03/05/the-first-90-days-10</id><author><name></name></author><category term="leadership" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">“Evaluating success and failure in realignment and sustaining-success situations is much more problematic. Performance in a realignment may be better than expected, but still poor. Or it may be that nothing much seems to happen, because a crisis was avoided. Sustaining-success situations pose similar problems. Success may consist of a small loss of market share in the face of a concerted attack by competitors or the eking out of a few percentage points of top-line growth in a mature business. The unknown in both realignments and sustaining-success situations is what would have happened if other actions had been taken or other people had been in charge—the “as compared to what?” problem. Measuring success in such situations takes much more work, because to assess the adequacy of their responses, you must have a deep understanding of the challenges new leaders face and the actions they are taking. ”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The First 90 days, Updated and Expanded - Proven strategies for getting up to speed faster and smarter - 9</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/leadership/reading_notes/2022/02/27/the-first-90-days-9.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The First 90 days, Updated and Expanded - Proven strategies for getting up to speed faster and smarter - 9" /><published>2022-02-27T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2022-02-27T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/leadership/reading_notes/2022/02/27/the-first-90-days-9</id><author><name></name></author><category term="leadership" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">“A baseline question you always should ask is, “How did we get to this point?” Otherwise, you risk tearing down existing structures or processes without knowing why they were put there in the first place. Armed with insight into the organization’s history, you may indeed decide that things need to change. Or you may find there is a good reason to leave it exactly where it is. A related learning block, as mentioned in the introduction, is the action imperative. The primary symptom is a nearly compulsive need to take action. Effective leaders strike the right balance between doing (making things happen) and being (observing and reflecting). But it is challenging, as Chris Hadley found, to let yourself “be” during transitions. And the pressure to “do” almost always comes more from inside the leader than from outside forces; it reflects a lack of confidence and a consequent need to prove yourself. Remember: simply displaying a genuine desire to learn and understand translates into increased credibility and influence.”</summary></entry></feed>
