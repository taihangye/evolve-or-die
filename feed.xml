Both of these statements are true, but for different reasons. If you think about a fast race car, it’s a more risky vehicle to drive, but if you know how to drive it, the risk goes down. There are two conclusions from this. First, having a margin of safety in terms of principal is a good idea. In other words, having a low withdrawal rate is safer than a high withdrawal rate, because the required rate of return is lower. A larger fund thus allows for more safety. Second, invest in what you understand rather than what people tell you. This is the main reason I’m not telling you what to invest in. If you don’t know anything about investing, make it a point to learn!”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Early Retirement Extreme - A philosophical and practical guide to financial independence - 21</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/investment/fire/reading_notes/2021/10/31/early-retirement-extreme-21.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Early Retirement Extreme - A philosophical and practical guide to financial independence - 21" /><published>2021-10-31T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-10-31T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/investment/fire/reading_notes/2021/10/31/early-retirement-extreme-21</id><author><name></name></author><category term="investment" /><category term="FIRE" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">“Caloric restriction has been shown to extend longevity in two senses: not only does it mean more years of life, it means more healthy years, as the body shows increased resistance to cancer and other degenerative diseases.

It’s trivially easy to use and I have been using it for a long time, first with actual pen and paper, later just mentally. Here’s how it works: Instead of buying when I develop a spontaneous desire to purchase something, I put it on my wish list along with the date of the wish. Don’t buy anything unless it has been on the wish list for at least 30 days. You will likely find that you have either found an alternative to buying it in the meantime, perhaps by finding an alternative or by learning how to do without it.”</summary></entry></feed>
