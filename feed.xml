If Steve Jobs was making an important decision and wanted to understand some aspect of it more deeply, he’d go right to the person working on it. There were numerous stories about relatively new, young engineers who’d return from lunch to find Steve waiting in their cube, eager to ask them about a specific detail of their work. He didn’t get this information filtered to him through the person’s boss or through the person’s boss’s recommendation; he went straight to the source. The more often you can do that, the more empowered your whole organization feels.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Radical Candor - 17</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/management/leadership/reading_notes/2022/06/25/radical-candor-17.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Radical Candor - 17" /><published>2022-06-25T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-06-25T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/management/leadership/reading_notes/2022/06/25/radical-candor-17</id><author><name></name></author><category term="management" /><category term="leadership" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">“One way to avoid this tension is to separate debate meetings and decision meetings. Another way to ease the anxiety of the people who want to know when the decision will get made is to have a “decide by” date next to each item being debated. Then at least they know when the debate will end and the decision will be made.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Radical Candor - 16</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/management/leadership/reading_notes/2022/06/23/radical-candor-16.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Radical Candor - 16" /><published>2022-06-23T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-06-23T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/management/leadership/reading_notes/2022/06/23/radical-candor-16</id><author><name></name></author><category term="management" /><category term="leadership" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">“ONCE YOU’VE SPENT all that time clarifying an idea—getting it really clear in your own mind and making it easy for others to understand—it’s tempting to feel like you’re done. Not so fast! The point of spending all that time in clarification mode was just to get the idea ready for a debate. If you skip the debate phase, you’ll make worse decisions, you’ll be unable to persuade everyone who needs to execute, and you’ll ultimately slow down or grind to a halt. Once again, you don’t have to be in every debate—in fact, you shouldn’t be. But you’ve got to make sure that they happen, and that there is a culture of debate on your team”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Radical Candor - 15</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/management/leadership/reading_notes/2022/06/23/radical-candor-15.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Radical Candor - 15" /><published>2022-06-23T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-06-23T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/management/leadership/reading_notes/2022/06/23/radical-candor-15</id><author><name></name></author><category term="management" /><category term="leadership" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">“ “Please poke holes in this idea—I know it may be terrible.
