Adopting a habit of positive recognition forces you to be on the lookout for things to praise, which in turn causes you to pay attention to what individuals are bringing to various projects. You don’t have to do this in public, but every week there should be at least one thing you can recognize about someone on your team. Even better, look for something to recognize weekly for everyone who reports to you.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">读书日谈读书 有感</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/reading_notes/2022/04/23/%E8%AF%BB%E4%B9%A6%E6%97%A5%E8%B0%88%E8%AF%BB%E4%B9%A6%E6%9C%89%E6%84%9F.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="读书日谈读书 有感" /><published>2022-04-23T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-04-23T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/reading_notes/2022/04/23/%E8%AF%BB%E4%B9%A6%E6%97%A5%E8%B0%88%E8%AF%BB%E4%B9%A6%E6%9C%89%E6%84%9F</id><author><name></name></author><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">《读书日谈读书》是翟东升老师在b站上写的一篇文章，里面谈了他是如何选书、读书以及突破书本身的牢笼的。读下来感觉有不少观点是和我自己的感受有类似的地方的。</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The manager’s path - 9</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/management/leadership/reading_notes/2022/04/23/the-manager-path-9.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The manager’s path - 9" /><published>2022-04-23T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-04-23T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/management/leadership/reading_notes/2022/04/23/the-manager-path-9</id><author><name></name></author><category term="management" /><category term="leadership" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">“How much coaching does this person need? A very junior person who’s just joined the team might appreciate more time than a senior person who’s in a groove. On the other hand, a senior person who is pushing through a difficult new project may appreciate more dedicated time for you to help her with some of the details of that work.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The manager’s path - 8</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/management/leadership/reading_notes/2022/04/23/the-manager-path-8.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The manager’s path - 8" /><published>2022-04-23T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-04-23T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/management/leadership/reading_notes/2022/04/23/the-manager-path-8</id><author><name></name></author><category term="management" /><category term="leadership" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">“New engineering managers think of the job as a promotion, giving them seniority on engineering tasks and questions. This is a great approach for ensuring they remain junior managers, and unsuccessful leaders at that. It’s hard to accept that “new manager” is an entry-level job with no seniority on any front, but that’s the best mindset with which to start leading.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The manager’s path - 7</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/management/leadership/reading_notes/2022/04/23/the-manager-path-7.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The manager’s path - 7" /><published>2022-04-23T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-04-23T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/management/leadership/reading_notes/2022/04/23/the-manager-path-7</id><author><name></name></author><category term="management" /><category term="leadership" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">“As the manager of a process czar, help that person get more comfortable with ambiguity. As with many of the manager pitfalls, an obsession with process can be related to a fear of failure and a desire to control things to prevent the unexpected. If you are honest and make it clear that it’s safe to fail and to be imperfect, that’s often enough to get your process czar to relax a little bit and let some ambiguity in. It is very important to keep process czars from spending all of their time seeking out the perfect tool or process, and especially important to make sure that they aren’t punishing their teams for failing to follow processes.”</summary></entry></feed>
