This is the definition of a wage slave. Wage slaves are free to change their job, but they’re not free to quit their job. Wage slaves are free to choose other products as long as they can afford it, but they’re not capable of creating alternatives to buying products, because they’re too busy working.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Topics I want to share</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/ideas/2021/09/24/topics-i-want-to-share.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Topics I want to share" /><published>2021-09-24T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-09-24T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/ideas/2021/09/24/topics-i-want-to-share</id><author><name></name></author><category term="ideas" /><summary type="html">Say goodbye to 996 as a software engineer Be a self-improver Achieve something bigger than yourself Plan and retrospect loop Choices decide your life</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Say goodbye to 996 as a software engineer</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/ideas/2021/09/24/say-goodbyte-to-996.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Say goodbye to 996 as a software engineer" /><published>2021-09-24T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-09-24T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/ideas/2021/09/24/say-goodbyte-to-996</id><author><name></name></author><category term="ideas" /><summary type="html">以下只是我的个人经历，不具有普适性，仅供参考。 在FB工作在很多湾区程序员的印象里就是卷，加之最近几年出现的各种社会性新闻，给人一种感觉在FB工作的人WLB总不会太好。确实，有的组会比较卷，半夜发diff，做oncall的也确实是事实，这个时候摆在我们面前的有几个选择： 继续卷burn late night oil 出淤泥而不染：坚持自己的作息，看看是否能维持正常的绩效（当然有pip的风险） 组里环境改变不了，那就改变自己：换组，换公司</summary></entry></feed>
