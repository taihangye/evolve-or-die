Education is supposed to transform and build the character, mind, and body of the students. The point of an education is to learn a systematic way of improving those aspects–exercising, researching, and figuring things out to build a foundation for continued learning for the rest of one’s life, so that one may live his life to the fullest extent possible. Learning must become a habit (see Ergodicity and destiny) that is applied to all aspects of life before it can be said that a person is truly an educated person.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Early Retirement Extreme - A philosophical and practical guide to financial independence - 9</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/investment/fire/reading_notes/2021/10/08/early-retirement-extreme-9.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Early Retirement Extreme - A philosophical and practical guide to financial independence - 9" /><published>2021-10-08T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-10-08T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/investment/fire/reading_notes/2021/10/08/early-retirement-extreme-9</id><author><name></name></author><category term="investment" /><category term="FIRE" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">The ability of connect disparate fields or items in complex ways and reach new creative solutions creates paradigm shifts.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Early Retirement Extreme - A philosophical and practical guide to financial independence - 8</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/investment/fire/reading_notes/2021/10/08/early-retirement-extreme-8.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Early Retirement Extreme - A philosophical and practical guide to financial independence - 8" /><published>2021-10-08T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-10-08T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/investment/fire/reading_notes/2021/10/08/early-retirement-extreme-8</id><author><name></name></author><category term="investment" /><category term="FIRE" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">“We have a political model that is based on leading in the popular polls–a model where barely differentiated political leaders pretend to be different by steering voters away from important issues and onto subjects that, albeit emotional, are of little consequence to most people–a model where the election is won by the person with the best marketing, and where consistency and integrity are irrelevant.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Early Retirement Extreme - A philosophical and practical guide to financial independence - 7</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/investment/fire/reading_notes/2021/09/27/early-retirement-extreme-7.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Early Retirement Extreme - A philosophical and practical guide to financial independence - 7" /><published>2021-09-27T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-09-27T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/investment/fire/reading_notes/2021/09/27/early-retirement-extreme-7</id><author><name></name></author><category term="investment" /><category term="FIRE" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">“In other words, luck is only important in the short term. In the long term, luck has little to do with success. For instance, a financially irresponsible person doesn’t become a millionaire by winning $1 million. He merely becomes a financially irresponsible person with $1 million, and eventually the lucky money will be gone. A person becomes a millionaire by becoming the sort of person who “deserves” $1 million.</summary></entry></feed>
