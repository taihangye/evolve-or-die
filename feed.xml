Changing one word made a world of difference. Instead of asking an implicitly judgmental question like, “Is this a person with high or low potential?” we encouraged managers to ask themselves questions like, “What growth trajectory does each person on my team want to be on right now?” or “Have I given everybody opportunities that are in line with what they really want?” or “What growth trajectory do my direct reports believe they are on? Do I agree? And if I don’t, why don’t I?” Sometimes people really want to grow and are capable of contributing more than they have been allowed to; at other times, they simply want more money or recognition but don’t really want to change the way they work or contribute any more than they do already. As the boss, you’re the one who’s going to have to know your direct reports well enough to make these distinctions and then have some Radically Candid conversations when you see things differently.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Radical Candor - 8</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/management/leadership/reading_notes/2022/06/10/radical-candor-8.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Radical Candor - 8" /><published>2022-06-10T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-06-10T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/management/leadership/reading_notes/2022/06/10/radical-candor-8</id><author><name></name></author><category term="management" /><category term="leadership" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">“Karen Sipprell, a colleague at Apple, asked two questions that were instructive: “How long do you spend making sure you have all the facts right before you criticize somebody? How long do you spend making sure you have all the facts right before you praise somebody?” Ideally you’d spend just as long getting the facts right for praise as for criticism.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Radical Candor - 7</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/management/leadership/reading_notes/2022/05/30/radical-candor-7.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Radical Candor - 7" /><published>2022-05-30T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-05-30T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/management/leadership/reading_notes/2022/05/30/radical-candor-7</id><author><name></name></author><category term="management" /><category term="leadership" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">“This is an extreme example of what I call Ruinous Empathy.

In a fit of frustration, I sent an email to about thirty people, including Larry, which said, “Larry claims he wants to organize the world’s information, but his policy is creating ‘clutter sites,’ muddling the world’s information.” I went on to imply that he was recommending the policy because he was focused on increasing Google’s revenue rather than doing the right thing for users.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Radical Candor - 5</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/management/leadership/reading_notes/2022/05/30/radical-candor-5.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Radical Candor - 5" /><published>2022-05-30T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-05-30T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/management/leadership/reading_notes/2022/05/30/radical-candor-5</id><author><name></name></author><category term="management" /><category term="leadership" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">“THINK FOR A moment about how Sheryl handled that situation. Even though the overall talk had gone well, she didn’t let the positive result get in the way of pointing out something I needed to fix. She did so immediately, so that the problem didn’t hurt my reputation at Google. She made sure to point out the positive things I’d accomplished in the presentation, and what’s more, she did so thoroughly and sincerely—there was no attempt at “sandwiching” the criticism between bogus positives. Her first approach was gentle but direct. When it became clear that I wasn’t hearing her, she became more direct, but even then she was careful not to “personalize,” not to make it about some essential trait. She said I “sounded” stupid rather than I was stupid. And I wasn’t in this alone: she offered tangible help. I didn’t feel like an idiot with defects, but a valuable team member she was ready to invest in. But it still stung a little bit.”</summary></entry></feed>
