It’s natural that employers prefer employees of the latter persuasion, as they can just break goals into smaller goals and hire an employee for each sub-goal. As an individual or a business, the focus should be on the process rather than sub-goals, lest the long-term perspective be lost.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Early Retirement Extreme - A philosophical and practical guide to financial independence - 15</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/investment/fire/reading_notes/2021/10/23/early-retirement-extreme-15.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Early Retirement Extreme - A philosophical and practical guide to financial independence - 15" /><published>2021-10-23T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-10-23T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/investment/fire/reading_notes/2021/10/23/early-retirement-extreme-15</id><author><name></name></author><category term="investment" /><category term="FIRE" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">“This figure shows a complementary way of mapping out the consequences. For those familiar with “fish bone” diagrams, this is the reverse of one. The taken position is a zeroth-order effect and it has first-order effects. Positive effects go over the line. Negative effects go under the line. Each effect also has second-order effects. Positive effects go over the line. Negative effects go under the line. It’s difficult to say if a position that has a weak positive first-order effect with a strong negative second-order effect or a weak negative first-order effect with a strong positive second-order effect is net positive. If this can’t be determined, the behavior is too complicated and should be avoided (see here). Hopefully this won’t be a problem and second-order effects can be ignored. However, sometimes second- and even third-order effects either add up or accumulate undetected for a long time before triggering spectacular event.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Early Retirement Extreme - A philosophical and practical guide to financial independence - 14</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/investment/fire/reading_notes/2021/10/17/early-retirement-extreme-14.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Early Retirement Extreme - A philosophical and practical guide to financial independence - 14" /><published>2021-10-17T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-10-17T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/investment/fire/reading_notes/2021/10/17/early-retirement-extreme-14</id><author><name></name></author><category term="investment" /><category term="FIRE" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">A very common and very good piece of career advice is not to work to earn money but to work to learn new skills, gain new connections, and create new opportunities.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Early Retirement Extreme - A philosophical and practical guide to financial independence - 13</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/investment/fire/reading_notes/2021/10/17/early-retirement-extreme-13.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Early Retirement Extreme - A philosophical and practical guide to financial independence - 13" /><published>2021-10-17T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-10-17T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/investment/fire/reading_notes/2021/10/17/early-retirement-extreme-13</id><author><name></name></author><category term="investment" /><category term="FIRE" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">“It’s important to understand that doing the right thing (good strategy) is much more important than doing things right (good tactics).”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">五年反思</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/deeplearning/reading_notes/2021/10/16/%E5%B7%A5%E4%BD%9C%E4%BA%94%E5%B9%B4%E5%8F%8D%E6%80%9D.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="五年反思" /><published>2021-10-16T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-10-16T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/deeplearning/reading_notes/2021/10/16/%E5%B7%A5%E4%BD%9C%E4%BA%94%E5%B9%B4%E5%8F%8D%E6%80%9D</id><author><name></name></author><category term="deeplearning" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">最近开始关注李沐大神的B站，李沐大神是机器学期、深度学习届的大牛，MXNET的主要作者和维护者之一，在分布式机器学习领域有很重要的贡献，现在任职于AWS做Senior Principal Scientist (应该是L8等级，如果硬要对标国内的话估计在阿里的P10,P11等级）。在翻看大神视频的间隙，看到了一篇大神的工作五年反思以及另一篇用随机梯度下降来优化人生，深受触动。因此，也想借此机会写一篇工作五年总结（08/2016 to 10/2021）来做一次五年反思。</summary></entry></feed>
