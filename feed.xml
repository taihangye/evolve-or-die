People frequently talk about climbing the corporate ladder. However, a ladder implies that if one climbs hard enough, one eventually will get to the top. In reality, it’s more like a corporate pyramid. Not only does one have to climb hard; one also has to beat the other climbers as the pyramid gets narrower and narrower.” “Here, one solution is to moderate one’s career ambitions. After all, realizing at an early point that going all the way not only depends on skills, but also requires 100% dedication, reading time, and possibly some ethical compromises, one can aid in the sorting process by consciously seeking positions suitable to one’s more moderate aims and avoiding unnecessary competition.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Early Retirement Extreme - A philosophical and practical guide to financial independence - 5</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/investment/fire/reading_notes/2021/09/19/early-retirement-extreme-5.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Early Retirement Extreme - A philosophical and practical guide to financial independence - 5" /><published>2021-09-19T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-09-19T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/investment/fire/reading_notes/2021/09/19/early-retirement-extreme-5</id><author><name></name></author><category term="investment" /><category term="FIRE" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">“The design presented in the rest of the book rests on three pillars. First, reduce waste and increase efficiency. Many of these expenses are eliminated by only owning what is actually used, and maintaining what is bought.” “Second, having significantly reduced expenses, invest the difference in businesses.” “Third, find something meaningful to do instead of work. If your work is really meaningful to you, you can keep working, knowing that you are living a less wasteful existence and that you have the financial security to leave your job at any time. ”</summary></entry></feed>
