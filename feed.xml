In the long term, luck has little to do with success. For instance, a financially irresponsible person doesn’t become a millionaire by winning $1 million. He merely becomes a financially irresponsible person with $1 million, and eventually the lucky money will be gone. A person becomes a millionaire by becoming the sort of person who “deserves” $1 million.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Early Retirement Extreme - A philosophical and practical guide to financial independence - 6</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/investment/fire/reading_notes/2021/09/27/early-retirement-extreme-6.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Early Retirement Extreme - A philosophical and practical guide to financial independence - 6" /><published>2021-09-27T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-09-27T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/investment/fire/reading_notes/2021/09/27/early-retirement-extreme-6</id><author><name></name></author><category term="investment" /><category term="FIRE" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">“Add lifestyle inflation (see The pursuit of stuff, status, and happiness) and you have a process that inherently demands more and more work while quite possibly providing less and less contentment. This is the definition of a wage slave. Wage slaves are free to change their job, but they’re not free to quit their job. Wage slaves are free to choose other products as long as they can afford it, but they’re not capable of creating alternatives to buying products, because they’re too busy working.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Topics I want to share</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/ideas/2021/09/24/topics-i-want-to-share.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Topics I want to share" /><published>2021-09-24T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-09-24T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/ideas/2021/09/24/topics-i-want-to-share</id><author><name></name></author><category term="ideas" /><summary type="html">Say goodbye to 996 as a software engineer Be a self-improver Achieve something bigger than yourself Plan and retrospect loop Choices decide your life</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Say goodbye to 996 as a software engineer</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/ideas/2021/09/24/say-goodbyte-to-996.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Say goodbye to 996 as a software engineer" /><published>2021-09-24T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-09-24T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/ideas/2021/09/24/say-goodbyte-to-996</id><author><name></name></author><category term="ideas" /><summary type="html">以下只是我的个人经历，不具有普适性，仅供参考。 在FB工作在很多湾区程序员的印象里就是卷，加之最近几年出现的各种社会性新闻，给人一种感觉在FB工作的人WLB总不会太好。确实，有的组会比较卷，半夜发diff，做oncall的也确实是事实，这个时候摆在我们面前的有几个选择： 继续卷burn late night oil 出淤泥而不染：坚持自己的作息，看看是否能维持正常的绩效（当然有pip的风险） 组里环境改变不了，那就改变自己：换组，换公司</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Early Retirement Extreme - A philosophical and practical guide to financial independence - 4</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/investment/fire/reading_notes/2021/09/19/early-retirement-extreme-4.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Early Retirement Extreme - A philosophical and practical guide to financial independence - 4" /><published>2021-09-19T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-09-19T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/investment/fire/reading_notes/2021/09/19/early-retirement-extreme-4</id><author><name></name></author><category term="investment" /><category term="FIRE" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">“A so-called career provides a similar sorting mechanism. People frequently talk about climbing the corporate ladder. However, a ladder implies that if one climbs hard enough, one eventually will get to the top. In reality, it’s more like a corporate pyramid. Not only does one have to climb hard; one also has to beat the other climbers as the pyramid gets narrower and narrower.” “Here, one solution is to moderate one’s career ambitions. After all, realizing at an early point that going all the way not only depends on skills, but also requires 100% dedication, reading time, and possibly some ethical compromises, one can aid in the sorting process by consciously seeking positions suitable to one’s more moderate aims and avoiding unnecessary competition.”</summary></entry></feed>
