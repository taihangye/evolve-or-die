A web does not fail catastrophically if it’s cut in a single, or even a few places. It’s resilient, whereas a plan is not. This is why having a strategy is much preferred to having a plan.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Early Retirement Extreme - A philosophical and practical guide to financial independence - 11</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/investment/fire/reading_notes/2021/10/10/early-retirement-extreme-11.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Early Retirement Extreme - A philosophical and practical guide to financial independence - 11" /><published>2021-10-10T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-10-10T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/investment/fire/reading_notes/2021/10/10/early-retirement-extreme-11</id><author><name></name></author><category term="investment" /><category term="FIRE" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">“The main mistake when dealing with an overwhelming amount of data and stuff is to reduce it, rather than relating to it on a more abstract level.

Education is supposed to transform and build the character, mind, and body of the students. The point of an education is to learn a systematic way of improving those aspects–exercising, researching, and figuring things out to build a foundation for continued learning for the rest of one’s life, so that one may live his life to the fullest extent possible. Learning must become a habit (see Ergodicity and destiny) that is applied to all aspects of life before it can be said that a person is truly an educated person.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Early Retirement Extreme - A philosophical and practical guide to financial independence - 9</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/investment/fire/reading_notes/2021/10/08/early-retirement-extreme-9.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Early Retirement Extreme - A philosophical and practical guide to financial independence - 9" /><published>2021-10-08T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-10-08T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/investment/fire/reading_notes/2021/10/08/early-retirement-extreme-9</id><author><name></name></author><category term="investment" /><category term="FIRE" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">The ability of connect disparate fields or items in complex ways and reach new creative solutions creates paradigm shifts.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Early Retirement Extreme - A philosophical and practical guide to financial independence - 8</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/investment/fire/reading_notes/2021/10/08/early-retirement-extreme-8.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Early Retirement Extreme - A philosophical and practical guide to financial independence - 8" /><published>2021-10-08T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-10-08T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/investment/fire/reading_notes/2021/10/08/early-retirement-extreme-8</id><author><name></name></author><category term="investment" /><category term="FIRE" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">“We have a political model that is based on leading in the popular polls–a model where barely differentiated political leaders pretend to be different by steering voters away from important issues and onto subjects that, albeit emotional, are of little consequence to most people–a model where the election is won by the person with the best marketing, and where consistency and integrity are irrelevant.”</summary></entry></feed>
