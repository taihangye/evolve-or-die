It requires frugality and an acceptance that at least some of what you’ve made is attributable to luck, so past success can’t be relied upon to repeat indefinitely.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Psychology of Money - Timeless lesson of Wealth, Greed, and Happiness - Comfounding Compounding</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/investment/reading_notes/2021/08/16/the-psychology-of-money-4.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Psychology of Money - Timeless lesson of Wealth, Greed, and Happiness - Comfounding Compounding" /><published>2021-08-16T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-08-16T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/investment/reading_notes/2021/08/16/the-psychology-of-money-4</id><author><name></name></author><category term="investment" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">“The big takeaway from ice ages is that you don’t need tremendous force to create tremendous results.”</summary></entry></feed>
