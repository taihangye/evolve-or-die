To live as a free person, following lists of easy, repetitive things, possibly in return for some reward, is exactly what should be avoided. Instead, it’s necessary to understand how the world works and how people have been specialized to the point of general incompetence, like ants, which only know how to do one job, but do it very well; this is not human nature. To live well, one must go beyond lists and start thinking creatively about solving problems.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Early Retirement Extreme - A philosophical and practical guide to financial independence - 1</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/investment/fire/reading_notes/2021/09/18/early-retirement-extreme-1.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Early Retirement Extreme - A philosophical and practical guide to financial independence - 1" /><published>2021-09-18T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-09-18T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/investment/fire/reading_notes/2021/09/18/early-retirement-extreme-1</id><author><name></name></author><category term="investment" /><category term="FIRE" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">这本书是2010年写的，Jacob Lund Fisker是比较早期Financial Independence Retire Early (FIRE)的倡导者。FIRE到后面也分成了LEAN FIRE, FAT FIRE等等很多种，而这本书主要是偏向于LEAN FIRE，大致就是尽可能削减生活成本，用很短的时间实现财务自由（作者用了5年）。作者在书中主要说了一种文艺复兴的人类，学习很多技能，尽可能自己做事，从各方面降低生活成本，避免消费主义陷阱，也给出了挺多实打实的计算（虽然不是重点）。书本身比较偏向于哲学而不是方法论，作者相信每个人有每个人自己的FIRE，而过多描述他自己的FIRE本身意义不大，授人以鱼不如授人以渔。 “At some point, the teacher introduced tests and grades. Test-taking became the primary objective; learning secondary. We had the option to quickly forget what we had spent the past year learning after the test was done. In other words, we were being taught to be “flexible.” Later, there were job fairs and educational fairs telling us how to write résumés and how to interview so we could get jobs. Yet, I never learned why the world worked the way it did, and in retrospect, I think nobody ever even asked the question. Everybody always only focused on the “what” and “where;” no questions asked.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">天才在左，疯子在右</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/reading_notes/2021/09/10/%E5%A4%A9%E6%89%8D%E5%9C%A8%E5%B7%A6%E7%96%AF%E5%AD%90%E5%9C%A8%E5%8F%B3.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="天才在左，疯子在右" /><published>2021-09-10T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-09-10T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/reading_notes/2021/09/10/%E5%A4%A9%E6%89%8D%E5%9C%A8%E5%B7%A6%E7%96%AF%E5%AD%90%E5%9C%A8%E5%8F%B3</id><author><name></name></author><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">这本书是作者采访一些“天才疯子”（主要是精神病人）的记录，每一章都是一个很有意思的小故事。 唯物论也好，唯心论也好，其实不冲突，大家看待事物的角度不一样。只要不用自己所掌握的去祸害别人，那就算自我认识提高了，没什么大惊小怪的。像我前面说的：你不相信并不能影响客观现实的存在</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Psychology of Money - Timeless lesson of Wealth, Greed, and Happiness - All together now</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/investment/reading_notes/2021/08/25/the-psychology-of-money-18.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Psychology of Money - Timeless lesson of Wealth, Greed, and Happiness - All together now" /><published>2021-08-25T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-08-25T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/investment/reading_notes/2021/08/25/the-psychology-of-money-18</id><author><name></name></author><category term="investment" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">“does this help me sleep at night?” is the best universal guidepost for all financial decisions.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Psychology of Money - Timeless lesson of Wealth, Greed, and Happiness - When you’ll believe anything</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/investment/reading_notes/2021/08/23/the-psychology-of-money-17.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Psychology of Money - Timeless lesson of Wealth, Greed, and Happiness - When you’ll believe anything" /><published>2021-08-23T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-08-23T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/investment/reading_notes/2021/08/23/the-psychology-of-money-17</id><author><name></name></author><category term="investment" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">“The more you want something to be true, the more likely you are to believe a story that overestimates the odds of it being true” “Why do people listen to TV investment commentary that has little track record of success? Partly because the stakes are so high in investing.” “Consider that 85% of active mutual funds underperformed their benchmark over the 10 years ending 2018.⁶⁵ That figure has been fairly stable for generations. You would think an industry with such poor performance would be a niche service and have a hard time staying in business. But there’s almost five trillion dollars invested in these funds.⁶”</summary></entry></feed>
