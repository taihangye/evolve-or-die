A very junior person who’s just joined the team might appreciate more time than a senior person who’s in a groove. On the other hand, a senior person who is pushing through a difficult new project may appreciate more dedicated time for you to help her with some of the details of that work.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The manager’s path - 8</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/management/leadership/reading_notes/2022/04/23/the-manager-path-8.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The manager’s path - 8" /><published>2022-04-23T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-04-23T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/management/leadership/reading_notes/2022/04/23/the-manager-path-8</id><author><name></name></author><category term="management" /><category term="leadership" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">“New engineering managers think of the job as a promotion, giving them seniority on engineering tasks and questions. This is a great approach for ensuring they remain junior managers, and unsuccessful leaders at that. It’s hard to accept that “new manager” is an entry-level job with no seniority on any front, but that’s the best mindset with which to start leading.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The manager’s path - 7</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/management/leadership/reading_notes/2022/04/23/the-manager-path-7.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The manager’s path - 7" /><published>2022-04-23T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-04-23T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/management/leadership/reading_notes/2022/04/23/the-manager-path-7</id><author><name></name></author><category term="management" /><category term="leadership" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">“As the manager of a process czar, help that person get more comfortable with ambiguity. As with many of the manager pitfalls, an obsession with process can be related to a fear of failure and a desire to control things to prevent the unexpected. If you are honest and make it clear that it’s safe to fail and to be imperfect, that’s often enough to get your process czar to relax a little bit and let some ambiguity in. It is very important to keep process czars from spending all of their time seeking out the perfect tool or process, and especially important to make sure that they aren’t punishing their teams for failing to follow processes.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The manager’s path - 6</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/management/leadership/reading_notes/2022/04/09/the-manager-path-6.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The manager’s path - 6" /><published>2022-04-09T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-04-09T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/management/leadership/reading_notes/2022/04/09/the-manager-path-6</id><author><name></name></author><category term="management" /><category term="leadership" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">“Run the project and adjust the plan as you go. The value of a good planning process is that it helps you know approximately how far the project has come, and approximately how far it is from completion. As things slip (and they always do), keep everyone apprised of the status. But now, instead of guessing how far you have to go, you can clearly point to the milestones that have been hit and outline the expected remaining work.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The manager’s path - 5</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/management/leadership/reading_notes/2022/04/08/the-manager-path-5.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The manager’s path - 5" /><published>2022-04-08T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-04-08T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/management/leadership/reading_notes/2022/04/08/the-manager-path-5</id><author><name></name></author><category term="management" /><category term="leadership" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">“Ultimately, the value of planning isn’t that you execute the plan perfectly, that you catch every detail beforehand, or that you predict the future; it’s that you enforce the self-discipline to think about the project in some depth before diving in and seeing what happens. A degree of forethought, in places where you can reasonably make predictions and plans, is the goal. The plan itself, however accurate it turns out, is less important than spending time on the act of planning.”</summary></entry></feed>
