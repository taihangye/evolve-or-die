A disturbing number of managers of managers suffer from an identity crisis: they’re not quite sure what their responsibilities are and how to meet them. The Pipeline model makes it clear that managers of managers should value teaching and coaching first-line managers—that as developers of talent, they hold the strength of the pipeline in their hands. They’re the ones who must help individual contributors adjust to their first managerial job, and they must make sure that these neophyte managers value being managers.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Angel - How to invest in technology startups (Chapter 18 - 21)</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/angel_investing/investment/reading_notes/2021/07/26/angel-investing-18-21.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Angel - How to invest in technology startups (Chapter 18 - 21)" /><published>2021-07-26T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-07-26T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/angel_investing/investment/reading_notes/2021/07/26/angel-investing-18-21</id><author><name></name></author><category term="angel_investing" /><category term="investment" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">Chapter 18: 提问与倾听 投资者问自己的问题 Why has this founder chosen this business? How commited is this founder? What are this founder’s chances of succeeding in this business - and in life? What does winning look like in terms of revenue and my return? 大耳朵小嘴巴 You want to have big ears and a small mouth in these meetings. You want to ask concise questions that take no more than a couple of seconds and then listen deeply to the answers, considering them with every fiber of your consciousness as you write your notes on paper—just like Columbo. 投资者问创始人的问题 - 策略性问题 What are you working on? Why are you doing this? Why now? (Why will this idea succeed now?) What’s your unfair advantage? (What makes you uniquely qualified to pursue this busines? What secrets do you know that will help you beat both the incumbents and your fast followers?) Sometimes, founders will not have an answer for this question. And that’s okay. This is one you often end up answering while looking in the rearview mirror.</summary></entry></feed>
