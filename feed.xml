ALL D is the primeval state and is evolu-tionarily stable. But cooperation based on reciprocity can gain a foothold through two different mechanisms. First, there can be kinship between mutant strategies, giving the genes of the mutants some stake in each other’s success, thereby altering the payoff of the interaction when viewed from the perspective of the gene rather than the individual. A second mechanism to overcome total defection is for the mutant strategies to arrive in a cluster so that they provide a nontrivial proportion of the interactions each has, even if they are so few as to provide a negligible proportion of the interactions which the ALL D individuals have. Then the tournament approach described in chapter 2 demonstrates that once a variety of strategies is present, TIT FOR TAT is an extremely robust one. It does well in a wide range of circumstances and gradually displaces all other strategies in an ecological simulation that contains a great variety of more or less sophisticated decision rules. And if the probability that interaction between two individuals will continue is great enough, then TIT FOR TAT is an extremely robust one. It does well in a wide range of circumstances and gradually displaces all other strategies in an ecological simulation that contains a great variety of more or less sophisticated decision rules. And if the probability that interaction between two individuals will continue is great enough, then TIT FOR TAT is itself evolution-arily stable. Moreover, its stability is especially secure because it can resist the intrusion of whole clusters of mutant strategies. Thus cooperation based on reciprocity can get started in a predominantly noncooperative world, can thrive in a variegated environment, and can defend itself once fully established.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The evolution of cooperation - 6</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/personal_development/reading_notes/2021/12/29/the-evolution-of-cooperation-6.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The evolution of cooperation - 6" /><published>2021-12-29T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2021-12-29T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/personal_development/reading_notes/2021/12/29/the-evolution-of-cooperation-6</id><author><name></name></author><category term="personal_development" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">“Proposition 4. For a nice strategy to be collectively stable, it must be provoked by the very first defection of the other player. The reason is simple enough. If a nice strategy were not provoked by a defection on move n, then it would not be collectively stable because it could be invaded by a rule which defected only on move n.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The evolution of cooperation - 5</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/personal_development/reading_notes/2021/12/29/the-evolution-of-cooperation-5.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The evolution of cooperation - 5" /><published>2021-12-29T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2021-12-29T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/personal_development/reading_notes/2021/12/29/the-evolution-of-cooperation-5</id><author><name></name></author><category term="personal_development" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">“What accounts for TIT FOR TAT’s robust success is its combination of being nice, retaliatory, forgiving, and clear. Its niceness prevents it from getting into unnecessary trouble. Its retaliation discourages the other side from persisting whenever defection is tried. Its forgiveness helps restore mutual cooperation. And its clarity makes it intelligible to the other player, thereby eliciting long-term cooperation.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The evolution of cooperation - 4</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/personal_development/reading_notes/2021/12/29/the-evolution-of-cooperation-4.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The evolution of cooperation - 4" /><published>2021-12-29T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2021-12-29T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/personal_development/reading_notes/2021/12/29/the-evolution-of-cooperation-4</id><author><name></name></author><category term="personal_development" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">“At first, poor programs and good programs are represented in equal proportions. But as time passes, the poorer ones begin to drop out and the good ones thrive. Success breeds more success, provided that the success derives from interactions with other successful rules. If, on the other hand, a decision rule’s success derives from its ability to exploit other rules, then as these exploited rules die out, the exploiter’s base of support becomes eroded and the exploiter suffers a similar fate.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The evolution of cooperation - 3</title><link href="https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/personal_development/reading_notes/2021/12/24/the-evolution-of-cooperation-3.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The evolution of cooperation - 3" /><published>2021-12-24T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2021-12-24T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://taihangye.github.io/evolve-or-die/personal_development/reading_notes/2021/12/24/the-evolution-of-cooperation-3</id><author><name></name></author><category term="personal_development" /><category term="reading_notes" /><summary type="html">“From the participant’s point of view, the object is to do as well as possible, regardless of how well the other player does. Based upon the tournament results and the formal propositions, four simple suggestions are offered for individual choice: do not be envious of the other player’s success; do not be the first to defect; reciprocate both cooperation and defection; and do not be too clever.”</summary></entry></feed>
