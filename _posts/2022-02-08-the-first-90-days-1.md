> “The point of the expectations conversation is for you and your boss to clarify and align your expectations about the future. You need to agree on short- and medium-term goals and on timing. Critically, you need to agree on how your boss will measure progress. What will constitute success, for your boss and for you? When does your boss expect to see results? How will you measure success? Over what time frame? If you succeed, what is next? If you don’t manage expectations, they will manage you.”

经常聊到manage expectation，这儿讲的比较细。定义中短期的目标，如何定义成功（地完成目标），在什么时间内完全，怎么让老板知道进度。完成目标后下一步是什么。

> “Aim for Early Wins in Areas Important to Your Boss
Whatever your own priorities, pinpoint what your boss cares about most, and aim for early wins in those areas. If you want to succeed, you need your boss’s help; in turn, you should help her succeed. When you pay attention to your boss’s priorities, she will feel ownership in your success. The most effective approach is to integrate your boss’s goals with your own efforts to get early wins. If this is impossible, look for early wins based solely on your boss’s priorities.”

老板的优先级，最想解决的问题就是你最需要解决的问题。如果能和自己的想要做的事结合在一起那当然是最好的。其实以前一直不是彻底理解这个问题，但最近发现老板承受的压力往往是来自同级对他的需求、质疑以及他的老板对他的要求，如果解决了这种要求，那自然你在他心中的地位和信任度也就会增加。

> “Whether you and your boss agree on expectations, try to bias yourself somewhat toward underpromising achievements and overdelivering results. This strategy contributes to building credibility. Consider how your organization’s capacity for change might affect your ability to deliver on the promises you make. Be conservative in what you promise. If you deliver more, you will delight your boss. But if you promise too much and fail to deliver, you risk undermining your credibility. Even if you accomplish a great deal, you will have failed in the boss’s eyes.”

承诺更少，但完全更多。这在大公司中是常见的，一个很典型的策略是，心里预期一个项目需要1个月完成，那和别人说至少要double。对于整个团队也是，要给团队留足buffer，不要overpromise。
