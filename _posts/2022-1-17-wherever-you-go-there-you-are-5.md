> “Awareness is not the same as thought. It lies beyond thinking, although it makes use of thinking, honoring its value and its power. Awareness is more like a vessel which can hold and contain our thinking, helping us to see and know our thoughts as thoughts rather than getting caught up in them as reality.”

自知和思维/想法是不一样的。自知更像是一个容器承载和观察着思维和想法的生灭。以第三视角看待自己的想法，但又不同于真正的第三视角，自知其实是有能力理解所有的想法的，只是需要去主动深挖。

> “Dwelling inwardly for extended periods, we come to know something of the poverty of always looking outside ourselves for happiness, understanding, and wisdom. It’s not that God, the environment, and other people cannot help us to be happy or to find satisfaction. It’s just that our happiness, satisfaction, and our understanding, even of God, will be no deeper than our capacity to know ourselves inwardly, to encounter the outer world from the deep comfort that comes from being at home in one’s own skin, from an intimate familiarity with the ways of one’s own mind and body.”

从外界是可以索取知识、快乐的trigger、智慧等等，但如果没有内化到自身，那也没有办法真正产生宁静、快乐和智慧。

> “For those seeking balance in their lives, a certain flexibility of approach is not only helpful, it is essential. It is important to know that meditation has little to do with clock time. Five minutes of formal practice can be as profound or more so than forty-five minutes. The sincerity of your effort matters far more than elapsed time, since we are really talking about stepping out of minutes and hours and into moments, which are truly dimensionless and therefore infinite. So, if you have some motivation to practice even a little, that is what is important. Mindfulness needs to be kindled and nurtured, protected from the winds of a busy life or a restless and tormented mind, just as a small flame needs to be sheltered from strong gusts of air.”

冥想其实不用做下来完全不受打扰地15分钟，和世界时间没有关系，是自己的内心能不能真正“停下来”审视自己。即使只有5分钟、1分钟，不断地联系是非常重要的。
