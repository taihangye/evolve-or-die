> “Run the project and adjust the plan as you go. The value of a good planning process is that it helps you know approximately how far the project has come, and approximately how far it is from completion. As things slip (and they always do), keep everyone apprised of the status. But now, instead of guessing how far you have to go, you can clearly point to the milestones that have been hit and outline the expected remaining work.”

> “Revisit the details as you get close to completion. Toward the end of the project, the tedium returns. It is time to really attend to the finishing details. What is missing? What testing? What verification? Run a premortem, an exercise where you go through all the things that could fail on the launch of this big project. Decide where the line for “good enough” is, socialize it, and commit to it. Cut the work that falls below the “good enough” line, and focus the team on the most important final details. Make a launch plan; make a rollback plan. And at the end of it, don’t forget to celebrate!”

对于项目管理来说，有一个初稿，随着进展有新的需求或者变化要及时沟通和调整，到项目快完成的时间要决定砍掉或者一定要保留某些功能。

> “You have a team. You have some control, but you’ve quickly discovered that getting people to do something is harder than just telling them to do it. You seem to have given up all control over your own day-to-day. Mostly you spend all day in meetings. You knew this was coming, but it’s not until you live it that you really understand what it means. When you only had a small team you were able to balance things and still write code, but as your team has grown you’ve lost touch with the code. It gnaws at you as something you should be doing, but there’s no time. Every time you snatch a few hours to write code, you realize that it would be irresponsible to check it in and make the team support it, so at best you snatch a script here, debug an issue there. Having the focus to build something big yourself is a distant memory.”

这段话是写到了心坎。湾区科技公司manager的控制力其实没有想象的那么高，更多的是影响别人做事。同时自己的时间也切的比较碎，团队的事优先级往往高于你自己写一点什么代码，尤其是不能做一个大项目，因为你会成为blocker，并且如果你写的东西，让组里去维护其实成本也会很高，因为组员在项目参与时没有亲自写核心的代码。
