> “They attribute the high failure rate of outside hires to several barriers, notably the following:
1. Leaders from outside the company are not familiar with informal networks of information and communication.
2. Outside hires are not familiar with the corporate culture and therefore have greater difficulty navigating.
3. New people are unknown to the organization and therefore do not have the same credibility as someone who is promoted from within.
4. A long tradition of hiring from within makes it difficult for some organizations to accept outsiders.
To overcome these barriers and succeed in joining a new company, you should focus on four pillars of effective onboarding: business orientation, stakeholder connection, alignment of expectations, and cultural adaptation.”

空降的管理者往往面对的是文化上的不适应，对于团队内部权利结构不熟悉，没有什么盟友，以及团队本身可能带有的排外性。

> “Getting oriented to the business means learning about the company as a whole and not only your specific parts of the business. As you work to understand the organization, it’s worth thinking beyond simply the financials, products, and strategy. Regardless of your position, for example, it’s beneficial to learn about the brands and products you will be supporting, whether or not you’re directly involved in sales and marketing. Focus, too, on understanding the operating model, planning and performance evaluation systems, and talent management systems, because they often powerfully influence how you can most effectively have an impact.”

对于Business oerientation来说，其实这个词本身比较难理解，但这儿解释的挺好的。就是要对整个公司不同方面有所理解，而不是仅仅关注于自己的团队。

> “Having to start learning again can evoke long-buried and unnerving feelings of incompetence or vulnerability, especially if you suffer early setbacks. You may find yourself mentally revisiting a juncture in your career when you had less confidence. Perhaps you will make some early missteps and experience failure for the first time in ages. So you unconsciously begin to gravitate toward areas where you feel competent and toward people who reinforce your feelings of self-worth.”

来到新团队，或是面对新的职位，很多事情要重头学习，会让人降低自信，甚至会犯一些过来人觉得很简单的错误。我觉得这种时候给自己的expectation就是要和老板align目标，快速 学习，小成本试错，知道什么是可行的。
