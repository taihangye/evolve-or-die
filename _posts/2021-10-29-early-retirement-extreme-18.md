> “you can gain the maximum utility by being relatively competent in large numbers of topics by contributing a nontrivial but fairly small effort. This means that you may gain more utility by being competent (journeyman level) in 10 different topics than by spending the same amount of time to become an expert in a single topic.”

作者比较追求技能的广度，相互之间还有促进作用。对于深度，作者的态度是需要有至少一项达到过专家水平，这样就对于新的技能可以用相对更短的时间掌握。

> “Substantial improvements don't happen incrementally by patching existing methods; they require a complete redesign.”

虽然巨大的提升不是一点点积累的，但少不了之前的积累。

> “Measure prosperity by less activity, not more. Do fewer useless things.”

现在这个社会总觉得做的越多越好，但作者认为少做无用的事，把精力集中在高边际价值和高影响力的事上。

> Focus on productive assets rather than stuff.
Focus on developing skills rather than on passive entertainment.

多做投资少买东西，多点技能少被动娱乐。
