> “When you are interested in being promoted, it’s very important to ask your manager for specific areas to focus on in order to get that promotion. Managers usually cannot guarantee promotions, but good managers know what the system is looking for and can help you build those achievements and skills. Again, this only goes so far. At more senior levels of work, opportunities for promotion are much more rare, and your manager may need you to find and propose the achievements that qualify you for the next level.”

这基本上是对的，针对IC3 to IC6（大致对应阿里的P6-P9)经理基本都知道应该怎么去做升职。但要从IC6到7，更多地是你自己要去发现机会，告诉你经理，让他能够帮到你。

> “You’ll probably go through periods of career uncertainty in your life. Many people feel very uncertain in their first two to five years out of school, as they settle into independent adulthood. I felt so unsettled that I went to grad school for a couple of years, in what turned out to be a quest to find security in the familiar academic setting and an escape from a job I didn’t know how to navigate well. I hit uncertainty again after climbing the technical ladder only to feel somewhat powerless at a big company. And then I hit it again after climbing the management ladder only to encounter the challenges of executive leadership. I expect I’ll experience it every 5 to 10 years until I retire, given my track record.
As you go through various stages of your career, you’ll start to realize how much uncertainty there is in the world. It’s a pretty universal truth that once you get the job you thought you wanted, the enjoyment eventually fades and you find yourself looking for something else. You think you want to work for that cool startup, and you get there only to find it’s a mess. You think you want to be a manager, only to discover that the job is hard and not rewarding in the ways you expected.”

基本上5-10年会是一个坎，职业上会有比较大的变化。比如我现在就是要从一个纯粹的tech track转到management track。但这也是一种自主的选择，如果选择停下脚步，那可能能过的比较舒服，但得到的成长也就变少。

对新进组的人来说，这个很重要，老人总觉得某些事已经说的很明白了，但新人可能对上下文还不熟，所以只是一知半解，或者觉得听懂了，但和老人说的不是一个意思。这个时候要慢下来，用不同的方式多重复几次。
