title: The Psychology of Money - Timeless lesson of Wealth, Greed, and Happiness - Never enough
---
> “The hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management was staffed with traders personally worth tens and hundreds of millions of dollars each, with most of their wealth invested in their own funds. Then they took so much risk in the quest for more that they managed to lose everything—in 1998, in the middle of the greatest bull market and strongest economy in history. Warren Buffett later put it: 
To make money they didn’t have and didn’t need, they risked what they did have and did need. And that’s foolish. It is just plain foolish. If you risk something that is important to you for something that is unimportant to you, it just does not make any sense.”

用最重要的东西去换取不需要的东西，每个人都会觉得不合理，但大部分人又在这么做，或是不得不这么做。

> “The hardest financial skill is getting the goalpost to stop moving.”
> “Modern capitalism is a pro at two things: generating wealth and generating envy. Perhaps they go hand in hand; wanting to surpass your peers can be the fuel of hard work. But life isn’t any fun without a sense of enough. Happiness, as it’s said, is just results minus expectations.”

最难的在于给自己设限。欲望是无穷尽的，即使是事先设限，如果没有想透彻，其实真正做到的那天也会觉得不够。Happiness, as it’s said, is just results minus expectations. 快乐就是结果减去期待值，说得真好。

> “Enough” is realizing that the opposite—an insatiable appetite for more—will push you to the point of regret.”

什么是足够了。足够了就是”拿到更多会让你后悔，因为你得到什么必须要失去一些东西“的反面。

> “There are many things never worth risking, no matter the potential gain.”

做人要有底线。有些东西失去了就永远拿不回来了。钱显然不是其中之一。
