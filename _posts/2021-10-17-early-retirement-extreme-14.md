> A very common and very good piece of career advice is not to work to earn money but to work to learn new skills, gain new connections, and create new opportunities.

这儿说的比较死。没人会和钱过不去，但如果硬要做选择的话，那机会、人脉、有意义的技能都是更高优先级的。

> “Slowness can be achieved through delayed gratification. In a world of scarcity, instant gratification is the optimal strategy. In a world of abundance, delayed gratification is the optimal strategy. Genetically, there's a preference for the former, which means that a mature person with a measure of self-control has an advantage, being able to wait for bargains. It also means if you have patience and don't depend on speed, there are fewer costs to be paid for the additional power that speed otherwise requires. It's helpful to master the art of waiting. We are prone to action, but often the problems we perceive as urgent turn out to be less than urgent. Sometimes they will even resolve themselves without any interaction.”

合理的等待，和延迟满足在很多时候是省钱，提高性价比的好方法。尤其是在物质丰富的时间，延迟满足的效益往往高于即刻满足。我们以为很紧急的事，比如新出一个什么产品，其实等一阵子价格自然下来了，甚至我们会想清楚也没必要买，可以有其他的替代品或者选择不种下这个因。

> “Another way to think of a heterotelic response to a problem is that it aims to fix a single symptom of, say, a disease. If the response causes undesirable side effects, additional drugs are taken in an attempt to fix these side effects. Here many arrows are used in the figure to try to get closer to the desired goal. The heterotelic response makes particular symptoms more bearable and tends to encourage more problem-causing behavior. If hiding the symptoms is effective, then Liebig's Law of the minimum suggests that additional symptoms will appear. If these in turn are treated heterotelically, then eventually the underlying problem will become so large that the system fails catastrophically (stress -> burn out -> depression -> heart attack) or simply becomes unsolvable.
Conversely, the homeotelic response aims to fix the entire problem--that is, cure the disease. Naturally, this is the ideal approach, but it requires a wiser approach to the problem. An important part of the systems thinking approach is to continuously increase the number of different problems that the strategy aims to solve or the number of different goals that the strategy intends to meet.”

停留于表面，不断给“系统”打补丁，最终会造成灾难性的后果。统一性的复杂解决方案去从根本上解决问题，满足多方需求是需要不断去思考和实现的。
