> “The wish list method seems to be widely known. It's trivially easy to use and I have been using it for a long time, first with actual pen and paper, later just mentally. Here's how it works: Instead of buying when I develop a spontaneous desire to purchase something, I put it on my wish list along with the date of the wish. Don't buy anything unless it has been on the wish list for at least 30 days. You will likely find that you have either found an alternative to buying it in the meantime, perhaps by finding an alternative or by learning how to do without it.”

这个把东西写在wishlist里30天后再决定要不要买的方法其实挺好的，避免自己冲动购物。尤其是对自己喜爱的东西，人们总是更不能抑制自己的欲望。

> “If I have to get something new, like rollerskates, I just get last year's model. Last year's inventory is typically cleared at certain times of the year, so keep an eye out and be ready to pick it up; it goes fast!”

真要买新东西的时候可以考虑去年出的“新产品”。这个非常适用于电子产品，就比如macbook pro，新款的性能大部分人都是用不到的，那就可以考虑在打折的时候买macbook air或者13寸的pro。

> “Low-intensity exercise (see the list of intensity levels in this table) doesn't burn many calories--a pound of fat, that is 4,200kcal, will supply enough energy for a 50mile run--and it doesn't burn any energy after the run. In fact, it may even be detrimental. Conversely, adding a pound of muscle mass increases the daily metabolic rate by 75-100kcal just to keep the muscle alive. It's thus clear that decreasing muscle mass is self-defeating as a strategy to fat loss”

提高新陈代谢率是减肥的有效手段之一，撸铁来增加肌肉质量，从而达到消耗更多的卡路里。

> “The optimal interval for strength and endurance is the Tabata interval, which means 20 seconds of all-out exercise followed by 10 seconds of rest and repeating this sequence throughout the entire workout; that is, working roughly 2/3 of the time. Increasing the weight and rest-to-work ratio prioritizes strength. Decreasing the weight and rest-to-work ratio prioritizes endurance. Pure endurance aims for working 100% of the time.”

休息运动时间比1：2是一个可以参考的指标。增加重量以及增加rest-to-work ratio可以偏重于力量。反思自己最近一年健身，感觉在没有加重量的情况下，rest-to-work ratio太高了，差不多做30秒休息1.5分钟。
