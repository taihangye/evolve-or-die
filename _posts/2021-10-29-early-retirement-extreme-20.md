> “The wish list method seems to be widely known. It's trivially easy to use and I have been using it for a long time, first with actual pen and paper, later just mentally. Here's how it works: Instead of buying when I develop a spontaneous desire to purchase something, I put it on my wish list along with the date of the wish. Don't buy anything unless it has been on the wish list for at least 30 days. You will likely find that you have either found an alternative to buying it in the meantime, perhaps by finding an alternative or by learning how to do without it.”

这个把东西写在wishlist里30天后再决定要不要买的方法其实挺好的，避免自己冲动购物。尤其是对自己喜爱的东西，人们总是更不能抑制自己的欲望。

真要买新东西的时候可以考虑去年出的“新产品”。这个非常适用于电子产品，就比如macbook pro，新款的性能大部分人都是用不到的，那就可以考虑在打折的时候买macbook air或者13寸的pro。
