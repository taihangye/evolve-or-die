## Three categories of potentials

* Turn potential: Able to do the work at the next level in three to five years or sooner (usually for tech this should be 1-3 years)
* Growth potential: Able to do the bigger jobs at the same level in the near term
* Mastery potential: Able to do the same kind of jobs currently being done, only better

## Seven dimensions to measure performance

* Operating results (cost, profit)
* Customer results (acquisition, retention, penetration, satisfaction)
* Leadership results (setting direction, communicating, developing people, setting standards)
* Management results (control, quality, timeliness)
* Relationships (working relationships, team play, internal and external, business and government)
* Social responsibility (doing right by the community, governments and environment)
* Individual technical competence (those parts of work only you should do)

## Three categories of performance

* Exceptional performance: Constant exceeding
* Full performance: Constantly meet
* Not yet full performance: Below standard

    * <span style="color:lightskyblye">**Light Sky Blue**</span>: Key stone. Main contributors of the org/team and need to be recognized and appreciated
    * <span style="color:yellow">**Yellow**</span>: A question mark. Need attention on either performance and/or potential. If people leaving, itâ€™s okay
    * <span style="color:red">**Red**</span>: An exclamation mark.  Need extra attention from manager and need to improve immediately. Otherwise, need to let go or be demoted
