> “And it is human nature for us to become attached—often unreasonably attached—to projects we’ve invested a lot of time and energy into. It can take almost superhuman discipline to step back, acknowledge when our results could be a lot better or are simply no good, and learn from the experience.”

对自己的项目，需要超常的原则去客观地评价

> “We are often told that changing our position makes us a “flip-flopper” or “erratic” or “lacking principles.” I prefer John Maynard Keynes’s idea that “When the facts change, I change my mind.”
The key, of course, is communication. Someone might reasonably complain, “Just two months ago you convinced me of X and now you’re telling me maybe not-X after all?” You obviously can’t change course like this lightly, and if you do, you need to be able to explain clearly and convincingly why things have changed. I’d often revisit the listen, clarify, debate, and decide steps with an inner circle. When it was time to persuade the broader team again after we’d reached a new conclusion, it was important to take a deep breath and share, patiently and repeatedly, how we’d gotten there, and to call out the change in direction explicitly.”

大的改变既要有勇气去承认（因为事实的改变），也要用一定的方式让相关人员知道为什么会有这样的改变，不是拍脑袋。

> “Think for a moment about hard times at work. You’re stressed out. You’re not sleeping. Your problems at work and at home are compounding each other. Hard times are made much harder when you’re not at your best. And they can make it particularly hard to “care personally” about the people you work with, not to mention those you live with. You’re too busy dealing with your own suffering. But “caring personally” is integral to building the relationships that drive everything else. The essence of leadership is not getting overwhelmed by circumstances.
You can’t give a damn about others if you don’t take care of yourself. And when you don’t care about yourself or those around you, everything else—including your results—gets out of whack.”

作为领导者，首先有centered on yourself，把自己照顾好，才有可能去对团队care personally，challenge directly

> “Be relentlessly insistent on bringing your fullest and best self to work—and taking it back home again. Don’t think of it as work-life balance, some kind of zero-sum game where anything you put into your work robs your life and anything you put into your life robs your work. Instead, think of it as work-life integration. If you need to get eight hours of sleep to stay centered, those hours are not something that you do for yourself at the expense of your work or your team. Your work and your life can give each other a “double bounce.” The time you spend at work can be an expression of who you are as a human being, an enormous enrichment to your life, and a boon to your friends and family.”

生活和工作并不是天平两端的砝码去要balance，而是你作为人活在世上的一个整体，生活中的事和工作上的事可以相互促进。当不能相互促进而是相互有负面影响的时候，甚至是一个负循环的时候，那就要搞清楚是什么导致了这个，而采取行动去调整。
