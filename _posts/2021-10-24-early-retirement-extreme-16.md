> “On the meta level, a process-oriented strategy is primarily aimed at living, with goals being accomplished as side effects, whereas a goal-oriented strategy is aimed at goals, with living as a side effect. It's natural that employers prefer employees of the latter persuasion, as they can just break goals into smaller goals and hire an employee for each sub-goal. As an individual or a business, the focus should be on the process rather than sub-goals, lest the long-term perspective be lost.”

过程为主，结果为反而是副产品。我觉得虽然要注重过程，但一开始的目标设定还是得要清晰的、可执行的，过程中注重体验和反馈，并及时调整目标。其实很多时候能实现的东西往往是超出或者不到我们一开始的预期的。

> “Tactics are often presented as lists. These lists are both helpful and useless at the same time. They are helpful because they allow people to pick up a thing or two that they have not seen before, but they are useless because few people are capable of memorizing hundreds of little rules that might not even apply directly to their situation and remember to obey all of them. In that sense, tips are like a collection of pretty postcards or pictures of specific instances of a particular way of living. They are interesting to look at, but they do not substitute for a map of the lifestyle, nor do they substitute for navigating the map, and most importantly, knowing them does not make anyone an expert.”

相比于记住一些tips，鸡汤，学会如何找到一件事的“地图”和“原则”，如何用“地图”为自己导航更为重要，因为一旦找到根本性的原则，那战术在很多时候就会变得很自然。

> “Focusing on utility rather than consumer products or instructions is a key tactic. Success is then redefined from accumulating and consuming the maximum number of products or the most expensive products to deriving the maximum utility.”

最大化的不是你积累了多少东西或者东西多贵，而是东西本身的价值比如耐用性、观赏性、对个人的独特意义等等。
