开始重读Wherever you go there you are。
> “By lost, I mean that we momentarily lose touch with ourselves and with the full extent of our possibilities. Instead, we fall into a robotlike way of seeing and thinking and doing. In those moments, we break contact with what is deepest in ourselves and affords us perhaps our greatest opportunities for creativity, learning, and growing. If we are not careful, those clouded moments can stretch out and become most of our lives.”

人非常容易陷入不自知的状态，没有自我意识地度过一天甚至一生。

> “At the end of a long life dedicated to teaching mindfulness, the Buddha, who probably had his share of followers who were hoping he might make it easier for them to find their own paths, summed it up for his disciples this way: “Be a light unto yourself.”

如何能够有足够的自知，别人的引导只能是领你入门，需要自己来引导自己。

> “It’s true. Ordinarily, when we undertake something, it is only natural to expect a desirable outcome for our efforts. We want to see results, even if it is only a pleasant feeling. The sole exception I can think of is meditation. Meditation is the only intentional, systematic human activity which at bottom is about not trying to improve yourself or get anywhere else, but simply to realize where you already are. Perhaps its value lies precisely in this. Maybe we all need to do one thing in our lives simply for its own sake.”

人们做的事基本是为了某个其他的目的，比如工作是为了赚钱。但冥想完全不为了另外的目的，只是让自己认识到现在这一时刻自己的所处。
