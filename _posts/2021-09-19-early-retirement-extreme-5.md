title: Early Retirement Extreme - A philosophical and practical guide to financial independence - 5

> “The design presented in the rest of the book rests on three pillars.
First, reduce waste and increase efficiency. Many of these expenses are eliminated by only owning what is actually used, and maintaining what is bought.”
> “Second, having significantly reduced expenses, invest the difference in businesses.”
> “Third, find something meaningful to do instead of work. If your work is really meaningful to you, you can keep working, knowing that you are living a less wasteful existence and that you have the financial security to leave your job at any time. ”

做减法，留下真正用的东西，好好地使用和维护。投资。做有意义的事，而不是无脑的做别人让你做的工作。

> “Each reinforces the other two, but none of them rely on the others. The money saved from reducing waste can be invested, and the method leading to savings can be cast as a meaningful activity. Conversely, meaningful activities can often provide income in a way that reduces waste. In addition, savings allows one to invest in better quality--for example, paying eight times as much for something that lasts ten times longer, instead of being stuck with a low-end model that only serves to increase waste and money losses.”

前面提到的三点是互相独立，但又互相加强。减少浪费可以增加投资，找出储蓄的活动本身也是有意义的事。而往往有意义的事可以增加收入和减少浪费。做投资也可以是买高性价比，高质量的产品从而减少浪费。

> “Coupling is a measure of a person's dependence on the world, economic here. In principle, it also measures the world's dependence on the individual.”
> “For instance, a consumer that is fully dependent on a paycheck is more likely to stay employed and not quit his job. Hence, employers can make the supply of labor more predictable by only offering full-time jobs, which makes employees unlikely to go home early, and tying in generous benefits, which makes employees unlikely to quit.”
> “It naturally follows that slack or loose couplings have a cost, in that they're less efficient under normal operations. Conversely, they're less costly under disrupted operations, such as in catastrophes. Changing the tightness or looseness of a coupling is therefore a way of adjusting risk versus profit. Here risk is defined as uncertainty rather than loss.”

耦合是系统成功(失败)和个体成功(失败)的紧密程度。给员工提供更好的福利，延长工作时间（使人们没时间想别的），是雇主希望达到可预期留存率的手段。简单的说每个人都有自己的很多想法，那这个人就不好管理。当个体不是那么依赖整体的时候，个体的风险（不确定性）就低了，整体的不确定性反而变高，整体效率下降。
