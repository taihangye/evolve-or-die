> “ “Please poke holes in this idea—I know it may be terrible. So tell me all the reasons we should not do that.” Once I put a YOU WERE RIGHT , I WAS WRONG trophy on somebody’s desk after her position on something proved to be correct and mine dead wrong.”

这个get feedback on ideas的方法还挺好用的。

> “Of course, it’s tempting to shut down in the face of these sorts of statements—“I don’t have time to deal with this right now!” But taking the moments to help clarify the ideas will save you time in the long run. Take the time to help your direct reports explain what they mean, so that they can do something about fixing the problem or pursuing the opportunity rather than just complaining about it.”

> “Part of your job as the boss is to help people think through their ideas before submitting them to the rough-and-tumble of debate.”

问问题，帮助clarify，让团队不仅能发现问题，还能进一步想想解决方案，然后再供更多的人讨论

> “Brainstorming sessions are often used to surface and clarify new ideas. These sessions are not just random conversations where nobody is allowed to say anything negative, though. There are plenty of bad ideas, and they need to be recognized as such. Poking holes in new ideas doesn’t necessarily kill them—it can push people to clarify their thinking. There are also great ideas that look bad at first blush. A good brainstorming session distinguishes between the two without killing too many good ideas or wasting too much time on the bad ones. Pixar has a technique called “plussing.” Rather than saying, “No, that is a bad idea,” people must offer a solution to the problem they are pointing out.”

> “Less dramatic than these kinds of formalized meetings and programs are your weekly 1:1s. (See Chapter Eight for specific suggestions on making 1:1s more productive.) These meetings should be a safe place for your direct reports to come and talk to you about new ideas. In this context, you shouldn’t judge the ideas but rather help your direct reports clarify their thinking. This is a form of “plussing.” You can point out problems but with the aim of figuring a way around those problems, not killing ideas.”

brainstorm session, 1:1 都是讨论想法，进一步探讨想法的好坏的地方，不要轻易kill一个idea，但也要承认有些idea确实是bad idea并指出怎么让它变成good idea，或者some part of bad ideas是有用的。
