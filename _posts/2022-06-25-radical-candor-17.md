> “One way to avoid this tension is to separate debate meetings and decision meetings. Another way to ease the anxiety of the people who want to know when the decision will get made is to have a “decide by” date next to each item being debated. Then at least they know when the debate will end and the decision will be made.”

目前roadmap就是这么在做，把debate和decide分开，并有一个准确的时间去做决定。

> “In his book A Primer on Decision Making , James March explains why it’s a bad thing In his book A Primer on Decision Making , James March explains why it’s a bad thing when the most “senior” people in a hierarchy are always the deciders. What he calls “garbage can decision-making” occurs when the people who happen to be around the table are the deciders rather than the people with the best information . Unfortunately, most cultures tend to favor either the most senior people or the people with the kinds of personalities that insist on sitting around the table. The bad decisions that result are among the biggest drivers of organizational mediocrity and employee dissatisfaction.
That is why kick-ass bosses often do not decide themselves, but rather create a clear decision-making process that empowers people closest to the facts to make as many decisions as possible. Not only does that result in better decisions, it results in better morale.”

不能是最老资历或者最talktive的人做决定。而是拥有最多context的人做决定，而领导者应该创造这样的环境给予足够的high-level business context，并极少的否决下属的决定。

> “The decider should get facts, not recommendations
When collecting information for a decision, we are often tempted to ask people for their recommendations—“What do you think we should do?”—but as one executive I worked with at Apple explained to me, people tend to put their egos into recommendations in a way that can lead to politics, and thus worse decisions. So she recommended seeking “facts, not recommendations.” Of course “facts” come inflected with each person’s particular perspective or point of view, but they are less likely to become a line in the sand than a recommendation is.
”

决策者应该侧重于事实、数据，而不是推荐，这样就防止一些ego和politics。
