> “Compared to a plan, which may be thought of as a string of actions, subject to complete failure if it breaks, a strategy is better thought of as a web of actions. A web does not fail catastrophically if it's cut in a single, or even a few places. It's resilient, whereas a plan is not. This is why having a strategy is much preferred to having a plan.

线性的计划很容易因为其中的一环偏差、出错导致整个计划出现严重的错误。在设计的时候需要考虑策略的每一环有哪些风险，每一环和每一环之间有哪些风险，关键的节点需要有plan B甚至plan C，当计划的执行出现问题时，有没有预案止损等等。

> “A web comprises and connects a person's thoughts, ideas, experiences, memories, goals, values, desires, connections, assets, liabilities, predictions and expectations. Here, a larger inventory of the aforementioned means there's a greater variety of possible strategies and that any given plan becomes more flexible. Focusing solely on the coordination aspect and ignoring the tactics can result in "clueless manager syndrome." Conversely, focusing solely on the knowledge of tactics or skills described in Human capital and necessary personal assets would only produce a person with a multitude of hobbies. Only the combination of skills and coordination will unleash the creativity of an expert. Creative synthesis occurs when you're able to see principles as an abstract model representation and apply the abstracted model elsewhere. With experience, you'll see that the number of such models in the world is actually quite limited.”

既要做到掌握节点之间的协调和全局，也要熟悉节点自身的运作规律。其实要做到这个是很难的，很少有人能够同时顾全大局，同时又事无巨细的关注到细节。当项目小的时候只涉及到5-10个人，还是有可能做到的，但一旦超过10个人，就需要有一定的结构和抽象，并设置一些“警报”去帮助自己管理整个项目。
发现一件事背后的模式和规律是很重要的，而这样大的规律其实非常有限：认清楚事物和人都是螺旋上升或者螺旋下降的，合理地运用好正负反馈。

> “This means that one doesn't need another 10,000 hours to become an expert in another field, even if it's only marginally related. It means that it's easier to master several different fields than is commonly assumed.”

当成为一个领域的专家，其实很多背后的道理都是相通的，因此成为另一个领域的专家其实不需要太长时间（当然如果是完全不相关的领域可能需要的时间更久）。
