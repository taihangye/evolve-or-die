> “Why are transitions critical? When I surveyed more than thirteen hundred senior HR leaders, almost 90 percent agreed that “transitions into new roles are the most challenging times in the professional lives of leaders.”1 And nearly three-quarters agreed that “success or failure during the first few months is a strong predictor of overall success or failure in the job.” So even though a bad transition does not necessarily doom you to failure, it makes success a lot less likely.
The good news on transitions is that they give you a chance to start afresh and make needed changes in an organization. But transitions are also periods of acute vulnerability, because you lack established working relationships and a detailed understanding of your new role. You’re managing under a microscope, subject to a high degree of scrutiny as people around you strive to figure out who you are and what you represent as a leader. Opinions of your effectiveness begin to form surprisingly quickly, and, once formed, they’re very hard to change. If you’re successful in building credibility and securing early wins, the momentum likely will propel you through the rest of your tenure. But if you dig yourself into a hole early on, you will face an uphill battle from that point forward.”

Transition其实不仅仅是指跳槽，也可以使同一家公司的升职，职责较大的变动（职位不变），内部转岗，部分重组等等情况。在这个过程中前3个月很大的程度上决定了后面的发展。这让我想到了在看safe withdraw rate (SWR) 博客的时候提到的sequence risk，就是在你退休之后前几年的市场如果进入熊市，那会导致SWR降低很多，换句话说，在转换的期间，无论是事业还是人生阶段，前期事态的顺不顺很大程度上可以预测未来整个过程的走势。万事开头难。

很多人会用过去成功的经验去做面对新的挑战。我觉得这是人的惯性和心里的依赖，甚至失败了也不清楚为什么之前管用的方法，现在新职位为什么就失效了。要用一个全新的心态去接受自己过去的成功经验可能不能直接拿来用，需要做调整，甚至成功的经验并不管用、有副作用，需要”忘记“那些，重头开始学习新技能。
