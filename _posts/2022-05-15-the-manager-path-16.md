> “Don’t rely exclusively on consensus or voting. Consensus can appear morally authoritative, but that assumes that everyone involved in the voting process is impartial, has an equal stake in the various outcomes, and has equal knowledge of the context. These conditions are rarely met on teams where each person has different levels of expertise and different roles”

meritacracy是比较好的选择，每个人对一个决定的相关度是可以一个从0-1的值，然后投票做一个加权平均。Ray Dalio在Principles: Work and Life里面就提到过这个。

> “Do set up clear processes to depersonalize decisions. When you want to allow for group decision making, the group needs to have a clear set of standards that they use to evaluate decisions. Start with a shared understanding of the goals, risks, and the questions to answer before making a decision. When you assign the ownership for making a decision to someone on the team, make it clear which members of the team should be consulted for feedback and who needs to be informed of the decision or plan.”

这个在我们现在组里做roadmap以及priotize different projects的时候就做的不是很好，在H2 2022就是一尝试：
1. 由每个成员提出一共X个项目，然后列出相关项目涉及的领域，找到相关的利益相关方和专家，然后制定一个大家都认可的标准，比如4分是不做短期内那会有很严重（比如系统瘫痪或者有巨大的风险），3分是不做短期（半年）不会有风险但1年内会有很高的需求，2分是不做在1年内也不会太多的风险和抱怨但长期（1年以上）是重要的发展方向，1分是有的话可以改善某些小的方面比如用户满意度或是系统性能小幅提升，0分是完全没有必要着急的项目或者太小（比如1周内就可以完成作为better engineer、或是side project就行）。
2. 利益相关方可以定出每个人的权重，然后打分
3. 最后X个项目做一个排序。按照最终的分数，选出钱Y个项目，然后分配给组里Y个人。

> “Do remember to be kind. It’s natural and perfectly human to want to be liked by other people. Many of us believe that the way to be liked is to be seen as nice—that niceness is itself the goal. Your goal as a manager, however, should not be to be nice, it should be to be kind. “Nice” is the language of polite society, where you’re trying to get along with strangers or acquaintances. Nice is saying “please” and “thank you” and holding doors for people struggling with bags or strollers. Nice is saying “I’m fine” when asked how you are, instead of “I’m in a really crappy mood and I wish you would leave me alone.” Nice is a good thing in casual conversation. But as a manager, you will have relationships that go deeper, and it’s more important to be kind. It’s kind to tell someone who isn’t ready for promotion that she isn’t ready, and back that up with the work she needs to do to get there. It’s unkind to lead that person on, saying “Maybe you could get promoted,” and then watch her fail. It’s kind to tell someone that his behavior in meetings is disrupting the group. It’s awkward, and uncomfortable, but it’s also part of your job as his manager to have these difficult conversations.”

作为经理，不能做老好人“nice”，而是实事求是的做反馈，并提高明确的要求，以及一定的指导。
