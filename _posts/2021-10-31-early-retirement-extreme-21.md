title: Early Retirement Extreme - A philosophical and practical guide to financial independence - 21

> “Caloric restriction has been shown to extend longevity in two senses: not only does it mean more years of life, it means more healthy years, as the body shows increased resistance to cancer and other degenerative diseases. It's a subject worth studying.”

这儿让我想起了在《lifespan-why we are age》里面提到了，适量减少食物的摄取、保持饥饿感会使得人身体的细胞某些基因得到表达，处在防卫机制中，抑制了繁殖，增强了修复的能力。

> “As mentioned above (see A comfortable addiction), if a brand needs advertising, it is probably because it is either difficult to tell the difference between it and another brand or because you would not otherwise want to buy the product in the first place.”
> “This means that once a customer has been hooked, the companies will try hard to keep him on, since the advertising costs are sunk. Thus, if you ever want to deal with a service company, simply ask to speak with their retention department to negotiate a better deal.”

获客成本是沉没成本，所以作为消费者来说，应该去拿到更好地retention deal

> “Voluntarily stepping out of the consumer cycle and saving enough to replace one's job with investment income instead of working isn't "normal." The great majority of people do neither, and those who do one almost never do the other. Anyone not consuming as much as possible tends to do so out of external necessity and thus doesn't have savings to invest. Anyone investing for income tends to have plenty of money and thus consumes at an average if not above average level. There are few doing both; most do neither.”

远离消费主义和让投资收入足够财富自由，这两件事很少有人在同时做。人没钱，所以买不起东西，人有钱了就买很多东西。主动地克制自己的欲望，即使很有钱了，也不买没有必要的东西，本身就是一件需要在成为有钱人之前就培养好的习惯。

> “An ecosystem has four components, which form a cycle: Abiotic (resources), producers, consumers, and decomposers. Modern economics only considers two of these relevant: producers and consumers. It ignores the finite abiotic resources and presumes that their only limit is the producers' ability to turn them into commodities. Similarly, consumers and producers ignore decomposition. Once our waste and detritus is dumped into landfills, lakes, rivers, and the atmosphere, and is out of sight, it is, for all intents and purposes, out of mind. Meanwhile, the finite planet is running out of its finite resources (duh!) and pollution keeps increasing and is starting to bite back. Typically, the economists solve this problem by waving their hands and mumbling something about substitution and human ingenuity. However, it's obvious that our cultural paradigm is incomplete and that resources and decomposition capacity can no longer be considered infinite.”

作者点出了工业化后的生产消费模型的问题所在：人们有意忽略了资源的有限性和分解能力的有限性。我们只在乎生产和消费。
