title: The Psychology of Money - Timeless lesson of Wealth, Greed, and Happiness - Nothing's free

> “Like everything else worthwhile, successful investing demands a price. But its currency is not dollars and cents. It’s volatility, fear, doubt, uncertainty, and regret—all of which are easy to overlook until you’re dealing with them in real time.”

任何事情都是有“价格”的。成功的投资的代价就是波动，恐惧，怀疑，不确定性以及后悔。

> “Many people in investing choose the third option. Like a car thief—though well-meaning and law-abiding—they form tricks and strategies to get the return without paying the price. They trade in and out. They attempt to sell before the next recession and buy before the next boom. Most investors with even a little experience know that volatility is real and common. Many then take what seems like the next logical step: trying to avoid it.

But the Money Gods do not look highly upon those who seek a reward without paying the price. Some car thieves will get away with it. Many more will be caught and punished.”

这里作者举了一个车的例子：你可以选择买新车接受价格的波动，你可以买个便宜的二手车选择相对低的不确定性，你也可以选择偷一辆车选择不付出金钱。类比投资，很多人选择“偷”车，只能赚钱不能亏钱，以为自己能够长期做到低买高卖，付出很少的代价（波动性，风险）去赚更多的钱。

> “Morningstar once looked at the performance of tactical mutual funds, whose strategy is to switch between stocks and bonds at opportune times, capturing market returns with lower downside risk.⁵⁰ They want the returns without paying the price. The study focused on the mid-2010 through late 2011 period, when U.S. stock markets went wild on fears of a new recession and the S&P 500 declined more than 20%. This is the exact kind of environment the tactical funds are supposed to work in. It was their moment to shine.

There were, by Morningstar’s count, 112 tactical mutual funds during this period. Only nine had better risk-adjusted returns than a simple 60/40 stock-bond fund. Less than a quarter of the “tactical funds had smaller maximum drawdowns than the leave-it-alone index. Morningstar wrote: “With a few exceptions, [tactical funds] gained less, were more volatile, or were subject to just as much downside risk” as the hands-off fund.”

太多的事实证明很多所谓的“策略”都是“失败”的：付出更多风险，收获更少，或是不能避免downside risk。这还是和60/40的无脑组合相比。

> “The question is: Why do so many people who are willing to pay the price of cars, houses, food, and vacations try so hard to avoid paying the price of good investment returns?

The answer is simple: The price of investing success is not immediately obvious. It’s not a price tag you can see, so when the bill comes due it doesn’t feel like a fee for getting something good. It feels like a fine for doing something wrong. And while people are generally fine with paying fees, fines are supposed to be avoided. You’re supposed to make decisions that preempt and avoid fines. Traffic fines and IRS fines mean you did something wrong and deserve to be punished. The natural response for anyone who watches their wealth decline and views that drop as a fine is to avoid future fines. ”

人们把投资的波动性，风险当成了罚款，是需要避免的，而不是本身就需要的成本。
