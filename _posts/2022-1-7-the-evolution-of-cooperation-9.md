title: The evolution of cooperation - 9

> “There is yet a third way in which some of the tournament rules are too clever: they employ a probabilistic strategy that is so complex that it cannot be distinguished by the other strategies from a purely random choice. In other words, too much complexity can appear to be total chaos. If you are using a strategy which appears random, then you also appear unresponsive to the other player. If you are unresponsive, then the other player has no incentive to cooperate with you. So being so complex as to be incomprehensible is very dangerous.”

当策略过于复杂以至于对手区分不了你在用什么策略，对于对手来说他就判断不准你会怎么行动，会导致没有动力和你合作。所以有时候耍小聪明，让别人摸不透也不是件好事。说到底还是那句话，目的是让自己到达最好，如何使得对手有动力和你合作共赢才是关键，而不是显示自己有多聪明。

> “One way to account for TIT FOR TAT’s great success in the tournament is that it has great clarity: it is eminently comprehensible to the other player. When you are using TIT FOR TAT, the other player has an excellent chance of understanding what you are doing. Your one-for-one response to any defection is an easy pattern to appreciate. Your future behavior can then be predicted. Once this happens, the other player can easily see that the best way to deal with TIT FOR TAT is to cooperate with it. Assuming that the game is sufficiently likely to continue for at least one more interaction, there is no better plan when meeting a TIT FOR TAT strategy than to cooperate now so that you will be the recipient of a cooperation on the very next move.”

TIT FOR TAT成功的关键之一就是策略非常明白，是一种公开了和你玩，你不得不配合的阳谋。

> “The advice dealing with how this mutual cooperation can be promoted comes in three categories: making the future more important relative to the present; changing the payoffs to the players of the four possible outcomes of a move; and teaching the players values, facts, and skills that will promote cooperation.”

如何促进合作：1.增加未来合作的可能性和持久度 2.改变各种情况的奖惩额度，比如合作本身就能比背叛获得更多利益 3. 通过教育价值、事实和技能来让大家明白合作的好处。
