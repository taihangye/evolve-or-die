title: Early Retirement Extreme - A philosophical and practical guide to financial independence - 6

> “Add lifestyle inflation (see The pursuit of stuff, status, and happiness) and you have a process that inherently demands more and more work while quite possibly providing less and less contentment. This is the definition of a wage slave. Wage slaves are free to change their job, but they're not free to quit their job. Wage slaves are free to choose other products as long as they can afford it, but they're not capable of creating alternatives to buying products, because they're too busy working.”

工作的奴隶：又是一个正反馈的例子，因为赚钱越多也要买贵的好的大的，为了承担这样的生活方式只能更努力地工作。

> “Unlike the salary man and the working man, the businessman doesn't risk losing his job, though he does risk losing his business. Like an exuberant artist or scientist, he is internally driven towards finding solutions and he does not wait for employment to start working--the businessman is an entrepreneur. The risk for the businessman comes from the tight coupling between shareholders and bond holders on one side and consumers and workers on the other side, all of whom must be satisfied with the businessman in the middle, lest capital and profits vanish.”

书里讲了四种人，salary man就是以一份为别人打工的工作为生的，working man是以多份短期工作卫生的有点类似于自由职业者，business man这里提到了是主动解决问题的，必须在股东、债权人与顾客、员工之间做平衡。

> “A Renaissance man is a person who is competent in a wide range of fields, covering intellectual areas as well as the arts, physical fitness, and social accomplishments. This contrasts with the more modern, specialized approach, where a person is encouraged to build skills in a single vocation and use the income from that to pay for everything else. ”

Renaissance man有点类似于handyman，会很多基本技能，很少需要甚至不需要用金钱去买很多服务与产品，大部分时间能够自给自足。
