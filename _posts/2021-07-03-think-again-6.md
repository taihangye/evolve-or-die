> To prevent overconfidence in your knowledge, reflect on how well you can explain a given subject.

这个其实是很简单的道理，但很多时候我自己也不愿意花时间去写下来自己的理解，说到底还是“着急”的心态，觉得自己会了，觉得应该更快地看完一本书，学完一门课。

> It helps you focus less on proving youself - and more on improving yourself.

证明自己是重要的，但不要纠结证明是对的，而是要找到正确的方法去做事以及时刻反思而提升自己的水平。

> Build a challenge network, not just a support network. It's helpful to have cheerleaders encouraging you, but you also need critics to challenge you. Who are your most thoughtful critics? Once you've identified them, invite them to question your thinking. To make sure they know you're open to dissenting views, tell them why you respect their pushback - and where they usually add the most value.

这个是需要刻意去做的事，希望能从身边的朋友比如ASES的小伙伴们开始。

> Practice the art of persuasive listening. When we're trying to open other people's minds, we can frequently accomplish more by listening than by talking. How can you show an interest in helping people crystallize their own views and uncover their own reasons for change? A good way to start is to increase your question-to-statement ratio.

Question-to-statement ratio（多问少陈述), 是一个比较新颖的名词。挺认同的，很多时候是自己在别人的问题中发现自己想法的漏洞，或者看到其它选项的优点的。

> Remember that less is often more. If you pile on too many different reasons to support your case, it can make your audiences defensive - and cause them to reject your entire argument based on its least compelling points. Instead of diluting your argument, lead with a few your strongest points.

很多时候说话没有重点的问题是想要表达的太多，列了太多论点，反而稀释了最重要的观点。
