> The ability of connect disparate fields or items in complex ways and reach new creative solutions creates paradigm shifts.

范式的转变往往是在交叉领域的碰撞中产生的。这也意味着一条路走到黑本身是会遇到瓶颈的，很多时候多角度，多学科的交融和相互印证反而能推动某个领域的发展。

> It is curious that experts recommend that investments be broadly diversified, while at the same time recommending that job skills should be highly concentrated.

投资多元化，技能多元化，道理是相通的。分工促进工业社会的高效运行，但对于个体来说技能和知识的广度是非常重要的，一专多能。

> “Intellectual goals for someone aspiring to be a Renaissance man are to
- be able to prioritize the relevance of information and be able to quickly research and find relevant information in many different areas. Learn independently and have an interest in doing so.
- have enough generalized knowledge to be able to understand the information and put it into the context of a mental framework, a model or a procedure, and use it to ask further questions.
- recognize which problems the model applies to, take the solution to one problem, generalize it, and apply it to another problem.
- be able to critically analyze the model, refine it, and combine different models to achieve an objective. Practice critical thinking in all aspects of life to reach a degree of rational certainty. Be open to new ideas but do not accept anything uncritically.
- synthesize interdisciplinary information and laterally connect similarities which are not immediately apparent, discovering new models and procedures.
- evaluate different methods, models, and procedures while effectively ranking them for utility, and picking the best one while recognizing the pertinence of other methods. Pursue relevant and correct knowledge persistently and consistently. Master the fundamentals.”
