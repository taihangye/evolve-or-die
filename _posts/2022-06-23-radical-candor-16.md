> “ONCE YOU’VE SPENT all that time clarifying an idea—getting it really clear in your own mind and making it easy for others to understand—it’s tempting to feel like you’re done. Not so fast! The point of spending all that time in clarification mode was just to get the idea ready for a debate. If you skip the debate phase, you’ll make worse decisions, you’ll be unable to persuade everyone who needs to execute, and you’ll ultimately slow down or grind to a halt. Once again, you don’t have to be in every debate—in fact, you shouldn’t be. But you’ve got to make sure that they happen, and that there is a culture of debate on your team”

有些debate是需要的，尤其是重大决策的时候，有些比较清楚的决定和项目，大家都在clarification阶段已经了解了，并且没什么其他concern其实可以跳过这个阶段。

> “Redirect them to focus on the facts; don’t allow people to attribute ownership to ideas, and don’t get hijacked by how others who aren’t in the room might (or might not) feel. Remind people what the goal is: to get to the best answer, as a team.”

就事论事，不要带着自尊心觉得这个想法是自己的或是别人的，最终的目的是以团队找到最好的解决方案。不要太在意不在discussion里面人的感受、想法。

> “If a person has been arguing for A, ask them to start arguing for B. If a debate is likely to go on for some time, warn people in advance that you’re going to ask them to switch roles. When people know that they will be asked to argue another person’s point, they will naturally listen more attentively.”

小技巧，让双方互相说对方方案的优缺点，这样更容易能够听别人的方案。

> “McKinsey had very consciously created an “obligation to dissent.” If everyone around the table agreed, that was a red flag. Somebody had to take up the dissenting voice.”

如果所有人都同意，完全没有反对的声音，必须要有人“挑刺”。
