> “Negotiate success. Because no other single relationship is more important, you need to figure out how to build a productive working relationship with your new boss (or bosses) and manage her expectations. This means carefully planning for a series of critical conversations about the situation, expectations, working style, resources, and your personal development. Crucially, it means developing and gaining consensus on your 90-day plan.”

最重要的当然是和老板达成一致，对于现状的分析，对于你的期待是什么，对于两个人的工作风格异同有了解，对于你需要多少资源去做事，对于你自己的职业发展的规划，两个人都要有大致相同的认识。

> “Build your team. If you are inheriting a team, you need to evaluate, align, and mobilize its members. You likely also need to restructure it to better meet the demands of the situation. Your willingness to make tough early personnel calls and your capacity to select the right people for the right positions are among the most important drivers of success during your transition and beyond. You need to be both systematic and strategic in approaching the team-building challenge.
”

> “Create coalitions. Your success depends on your ability to influence people outside your direct line of control. Supportive alliances, both internal and external, are necessary if you are to achieve your goals. You therefore should start right away to identify those whose support is essential for your success, and to figure out how to line them up on your side.”

除了老板外，你的团队以及和你与你的团队有关系的团队（联盟），你也需要有意识地去分析现状以及为了达成你团队的目标，怎么安排人员，怎么和别人去沟通达成共同的目标等等
