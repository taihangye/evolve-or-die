> The information's only value is in how it is interpreted through the mental models of the "listener".

At the end of the day, all the data (information) related operations e.g. collection, analysis, ML/AI etc. is all aiming for serving the people who is consuming it. People's interpretation and decision made from those interpretation is equally important as the data, algorithm and computation itself. People embrace different values and principles, and as a result, see the same result (derived from the raw data) with different lens. Meanwhile, the ability to interpret the data with the guide of one's value and principle needs a a lot of learning an pratices in order to take "wise" action. 

> I use seven qualities to distinguish conscious from unconscious employees. The first three are character attributes: unconditional responsibility, essential integrity, and ontological humility. The next three are interpersonal skills: authentic communication, constructive negotiation, and impeccable coordination. The seventh quality is an enabling condition for the previous six: emotional master.

This book is centered around these seven qualities to achieve concious business.
