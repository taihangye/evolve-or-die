title: Early Retirement Extreme - A philosophical and practical guide to financial independence - 7
---
>“In other words, luck is only important in the short term. In the long term, luck has little to do with success. For instance, a financially irresponsible person doesn't become a millionaire by winning $1 million. He merely becomes a financially irresponsible person with $1 million, and eventually the lucky money will be gone. A person becomes a millionaire by becoming the sort of person who "deserves" $1 million. 

怎么成为"百万富翁"？买彩票赢了一百万并不能让一个人成为百万富翁。是一个人的头脑有能力让他拥有一百万，他才能有机会成为并保持百万富翁。

> “Conversely, my dream was financial independence, which means that investment income safely covers expenses. Hence, I spent most of my time thinking about how I could a) lower my expenses and b) increase my investment income. Hence, I didn't have a particular net worth in mind, nor did I think particularly hard about ways to make more money.”

对于财富自由的定义有很多。作者的定义是投资带来的收入可以安全的支付开销，那为了实现目标，就要研究增加投资收入和减少开销。至于要赚更多的钱，其实并不是直接目标。假设一年10万可以让你过的很好（考虑通胀），那就要研究怎么样让自己的开销控制在10w以下，并怎么让投资收入能够足以长期支持每年10万（考虑通胀)的开销。

> “Combined with self-confidence, agency is the attitude that any problem can be fixed, given enough resources in the form of time, effort, and determination. This attitude rests either on a thorough knowledge of or training in what is to be done, or on the surety that such knowledge or training can be attained. This attitude is often transferable from one field to another, completely unrelated field. Doing something that is considered very difficult at least once in your life is highly recommended.”

只要投入足够资源（时间，努力和决心）任何问题都是可以被解决的。这样的经验是可以转移到不同的领域的，甚至是毫不相关的领域。
