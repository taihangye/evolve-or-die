> “Negotiating success means proactively engaging with your new boss to shape the game so that you have a fighting chance of achieving desired goals. Many new leaders just play the game, reactively taking their situation as given—and failing as a result. The alternative is to shape the game by negotiating with your boss to establish realistic expectations, reach consensus, and secure sufficient resources.”

和老板讨论成功的定义，合理的期待，你能拿到的资源。

> “Don’t surprise your boss. It’s no fun bringing your boss bad news. However, most bosses consider it a far greater sin not to report emerging problems early enough. Worst of all is for your boss to learn about a problem from someone else. It’s usually best to give your new boss at least a heads-up as soon as you become aware of a developing problem.”

这个确实是很重要的点，隐瞒比坏消息更坏，因为往往为时太晚不能不久了

> “This is a good thing to keep in mind in dealing with direct reports, too. It can be dangerous to say, “Don’t bring me problems, bring me solutions.” Far better is, “Don’t just bring me problems, bring me plans for how we can begin to address them.”

这也是j经常聊的一点，提出问题很关键，但不是全部。我也觉得一开始不需要一个完整的计划，而是提出一些可能性可以开始讨论并衡量那种可能性最适合解决问题。

> “Don’t run down your checklist. There is a tendency, even for senior leaders, to use meetings with a boss as an opportunity to run through your checklist of what you’ve been doing. Sometimes this is appropriate, but it is rarely what your boss needs or wants to hear. You should assume she wants to focus on the most important things you’re trying to do and how she can help. Don’t go in without at most three things you really need to share or on which you need action.”

我和老板聊天的时候从来不会说我最近做了ABCD, 而是我们觉得最重要的几件事会深入讨论。
