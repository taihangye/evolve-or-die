title: The manager's path - 4

> “It can be hard to balance the work of project management and oversight with hands-on technical delivery. Some days you’re on a maker’s schedule, and some days you’re on a manager’s schedule. Through trial and error, you’ll need to learn how to manage your time to provide yourself with appropriately sized blocks to work in. The worst scheduling mistake is allowing yourself to get pulled randomly into meetings. It is very difficult to get into the groove of writing code if you’re interrupted every hour by a meeting.”

> “You also know that it’s important to get your team into a schedule that allows them to be focused on development for long stretches of time, because they will need to focus for several days on coding problems. Part of your leadership is helping the other stakeholders, such as your boss and the product manager, respect the team’s focus and set up meeting calendars that are not overwhelming for individual contributors.”

不能同意更多，最近的状态就是又要写代码测试，又要管理团队和项目。会有manager's schedule和maker’s schedule的冲突，一开始我觉得每天把两者交叉起来可行，比如早上10-11：30下午2-3点写代码，其他时间开会，看项目等等，现在发现在一天之内的交叉对于我的撕裂感太强，尤其是写代码往往1-2小时根本不能静下心来写，每隔一天还得再想之前写到哪儿了。现在我尽量会把写代码安排到一整个下午，不受打扰地写。但长久来看，慢慢成为manager后，应该不能成为一个项目的主要输出，因为这样会导致没有时间兼顾大局。

TL的责任是对整体系统的理解和设计，以及如何把商业需求转化成具体的产品和服务，然后带领团队去完成。

> “Why is the tech lead role such a heavy burden? The tech lead has a much wider scope of responsibility than the senior engineer in an individual contributor position. The tech lead is called on to help architect a project, and then to go through the steps of actually planning out the work. The tech lead is expected to make sure the team fully understands the project requirements, the work is planned, and the team is effective and performing well, all without necessarily having any management responsibilities and usually without any specific training. And, realistically, most managers will expect their tech leads to continue to write almost as much code as they did before they took on the lead role. It’s generally a pure increase in responsibility and scope of work. If you’re a first-time tech lead, you have your hands very full.”

对于TL来说，在创业公司的话，确实会可能需要写不少代码，看到过很多TL白天开会，帮组员，晚上自己输出。个人觉得自己是无法做到这种强度的工作的，而且当组变得更大（>10人）后，可能个人的输出就变得不是那么重要，除非是别人都写不出来的东西。
