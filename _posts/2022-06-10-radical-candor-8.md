> “Karen Sipprell, a colleague at Apple, asked two questions that were instructive: “How long do you spend making sure you have all the facts right before you criticize somebody? How long do you spend making sure you have all the facts right before you praise somebody?” Ideally you’d spend just as long getting the facts right for praise as for criticism.”

发现自己有时候就没有花足够的时间了解为什么要表扬和批评某个工作

> “Everyone must find their own way to criticize people without discouraging them. Steve Jobs’s guidance style is certainly not for everyone, but it’s worth understanding where he was coming from.

JOBS: I don’t mind being wrong. And I’ll admit that I’m wrong a lot. It doesn’t really matter to me too much. What matters to me is that we do the right thing.

In my experience, people who are more concerned with getting to the right answer than with being right make the best bosses. That’s because they keep learning and improving, and they push the people who work for them to do the same. A boss’s Radically Candid guidance helps the people working for them do the best work of their lives.

不要担心自己是错的，最重要的是找到什么是对的或是更好地，自我的反思和成长，以及鼓励身边的人也做同样的事是一个好的老板，团队也能做出最好的成绩

> “To keep a team cohesive, you need both rock stars and superstars, she explained. Rock stars are solid as a rock. Think the Rock of Gibraltar, not Bruce Springsteen. The rock stars love their work. They have found their groove. They don’t want the next job if it will take them away from their craft. Not all artists want to own a gallery; in fact, most don’t. If you honor and reward the rock stars, they’ll become the people you most rely on. If you promote them into roles they don’t want or aren’t suited for, however, you’ll lose them—or, even worse, wind up firing them. Superstars, on the other hand, need to be challenged and given new opportunities to grow constantly.

发现团队中其实rock star相对会比super star要多一些。对不同人的策略要不一样，不能对所有人都鼓励升职或者做更难的事。
