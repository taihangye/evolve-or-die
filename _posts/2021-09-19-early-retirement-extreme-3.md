> “We create problems, spend the next day solving them, and then claim we have made progress. We're even following Keynes' suggestion quite literally when we dig resources out of the ground, fashion them into consumer objects, temporarily store them in our homes, rarely use them, and eventually replace them with a new and bigger model, while sending the old and likely still functional object to a landfill--back in the ground”

什么是现代社会，把资源从地里挖出来，做出产品，暂时的被人们买回家存放，很多时候很少回去用，很快出了更新的产品，人们就把旧的产品扔了，重新回到土地掩埋。这样的东西在生活中可太多了，比如自己的switch，电视，无人机，gopro等等。

> Living to work and spend, it's not surprising that people derive their main identity through their job title and their purchases:"what do you do for a living and which brand names do you buy to express your lifestyle?"

物化，每个人对身份的定义往往是“我叫xxx，我在xxx公司做xxx”，而别人判断你个人的“品味”也是通过你的衣着打扮，用的产品，开的车等等来判断。我们往往都太容易通过外表去判断一个人，贴一个标签，下一个结论。

> “This figure shows a narrow delta function representing the skills of a specialist. A dotted line and an arrow represents the shift in demand. The demand now lies almost entirely out of the specialist's supply. This requires the specialist to work very hard to stay on target. The figure also shows a wider bell curve that represents the skills of the generalist. During a similar demand shift, the overlap between the new demand and the generalist's supply is substantial.
Here, a large problem is that previously acquired, specialized knowledge can't be used as a foundation for new specialized knowledge--by definition, only generalized knowledge can serve this purpose.”
> “The only thing the specialist knows is how much effort it took to reach the level of the former specialization and that this must now be repeated probably several more times throughout his career.”
> Creating a system based on specialized production thus increases productivity, but at the cost of increased risk to and pressure on the individual.

知识面和技能面现代人完全比不了“古代”人。这带来了一个很严重的问题，那就是过于专业之后切换跑到的难度就非常大，尤其是跨行业。从投资的角度来说，就是all-in一个资产和多样化的区别。
