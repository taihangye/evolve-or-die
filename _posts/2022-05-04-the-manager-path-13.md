title: The manager's path - 13

> “I have an employee who seems stuck. He’s been with the company for a couple of years and done OK work, but I don’t think he has the potential to be promoted further on our team. Every time he asks what he needs to do to get to the next level, I tell him, but he then goes back to his comfort zone, and no amount of nudging seems to bring about any change. What should I do?
> This is a fairly common occurrence that managers have to handle. You have an employee who has topped out in the organization and seems to be losing energy. He has achieved expectations in his level, but can’t figure out how to grow enough to get to the next level, despite your efforts. It may be time to coach him out.
Many organizations have a rule of “up or out” for early-career employees. The entry levels of most engineering career ladders expect that people at those levels will progress within a certain period of time, and if they don’t, they aren’t meeting expectations and will be fired. Generally, you want to make sure that long-term employees are capable of doing their day-to-day work independently, without a lot of oversight or help. However, once people have gotten past these up-or-out career points, what do you do when they get stuck?
Some people will be happy cruising as senior engineers or managers at a certain level for their whole careers, and if you’re both satisfied with the work, there’s nothing wrong with that. Others, like your employee, want to progress but for whatever reason don’t seem to be able to do it on your team. You owe it to your employee to be clear that this is the case. This is what is meant by “coaching out.” Make the situation clear to him. You have told him repeatedly what the next level looks like, and he has not been able to show that he can work at that level, so you don’t think that your team is the right place for him to grow his career. You aren’t firing him, but you are telling him that he needs to move on if he wants to progress.
Give the employee a chance to find a job in another part of the organization or at another company. When he does, let him go happily, and do your best to retain goodwill. Former couples who break up because they don’t see a future together can remain friends, and the same goes for former employees who simply need a different team or company to shine.”

这个回答很全面了。
1. 对于up-or-out的新人来说，fb就是3到4最多24个月，4到5最多33个月。会有yellow zone，red zone一说。这种时候需要非常明确这个问题。
2. 对于已经到senior能够独立完成任务的员工来说分成两种情况
a. 不想继续升职，可以很好的完成任务，那不需要强求继续成长
b. 想继续升职，但要么组里没有足够的空间，或者他不知道什么原因就是没有办法在这个组成长到他想要的程度。这种情况就可以让他看看其他机会（内部转组比如infra转product，或者跳槽）

> “The engineering lead will spend less time writing code, but they still engage in small technical deliverables, such as bug fixes and small features, without blocking or slowing down the progress of their team. More than writing code, they hold responsibility for identifying bottlenecks in the process and roadblocks to success for their team and clearing these roadblocks.
> The person who fills this role is expected to have a large impact on the success of [the organization] as a whole. In particular, leaders in this role are capable of identifying the most high-value projects and keeping their team focused on these projects. As part of keeping the team focused, the engineering lead will partner closely with the product lead to manage project scope and ensure the technical deliverables are met. In addition to focusing the team, they are capable of identifying headcount needs for the team and planning and recruiting to fill these needs.
> The engineering lead is an independent manager. They are comfortable managing team members with different skill sets from their own. They communicate expectations clearly to all team members, and solicit and deliver individual feedback frequently (not just in the scope of review periods). In addition to strong management skills, the engineering lead acts as a leader for the technical roadmap for their product group (pillar). They clearly communicate the timeline, scope, and risks to their pillar partners, and lead the delivery of major initiatives on clear timelines. Additionally, they identify areas of strategic technical debt, do the cost/benefit analysis for resolving this debt, and communicate suggested timelines for prioritizing this to the management team.”

对一线经理的jd。有足够的技术能力可以发现瓶颈和路障，对组织的成功负责，有愿景和可执行的计划，知道如何平衡新需求和换技术宅。
