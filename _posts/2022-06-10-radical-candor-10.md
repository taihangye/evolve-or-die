> “One result is described hilariously in Laurence J. Peter’s book The Peter Principle . The Peter Principle results in people getting promoted beyond their level of competence—an unhappy situation for everyone, especially the person who’s been promoted.”

> “Another version of the bad promotion occurs when people are competent for the next job but have no desire to do it at that moment in their lives. I once had a colleague who’d planned carefully so that when he had his first baby he was in a job that he’d mastered and thus could get home to be with his newborn. His boss, however, had different plans for him: a promotion. When informed of his promotion, the man declined it. When told it wasn’t optional, he quit. What a waste.”

两种不好的升职：德不配位，工作外的情况不允许。

> “The best way to keep superstars happy is to challenge them and make sure they are constantly learning. Give them new opportunities, even when it is sometimes more work than seems feasible for one person to do. Figure out what the next job for them will be. Build an intellectual partnership with them. Find them mentors from outside your team or organization—people who have even more to offer than you do. But make sure you don’t get too dependent on them; ask them to teach others on the team to do their job, because they won’t stay in their existing role for long. I often thought of these people as shooting stars—my team and I were lucky to have them in our orbit for a little while, but trying to hold them there was futile.”

对于高成长性高绩效的super star来说，要让他们保持足够挑战的同时，也要让他们带团队中其他人学会他能做的事，因为super star是不会安于只在一个地方待太久的。

> “Sadly, lots of people never find work they are truly excellent at because they stay in the wrong job so long that any change would require a step or two backward. They may have come to depend on the prestige and money of the current position, and feel pressure from family to keep it. Bosses keep this kind of employee on for several reasons: they’re not sure they can find someone better; it takes time and effort to train new people; and they like the person and feel it would be unfair to encourage them to find a job they are better suited for.”

鸡肋，弃之可惜，食之无味。尤其是对方也没有意愿要离开的情况下，manager可以做的就是两种选择，让对方主动离职（找到更适合的职位），或者裁员。
