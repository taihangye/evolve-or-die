> “Whatever the source of the mentoring arrangement, common mentoring pitfalls include viewing it as a low-status “emotional labor” position, assuming that “like” must mentor “like,” and failing to use the opportunity to observe potential on your team firsthand.
Emotional labor is a way to think about traditionally feminine “soft skills”—that is, skills that address the emotional needs of people and teams. Because the outcome can be hard to quantitatively measure, emotional labor is often dismissed as less important work than writing software. It’s assumed to be something that should just be provided without financial recognition. I’m not suggesting that you should pay people extra money to serve as mentors, but they need to be recognized for the work they put in, and the mentor should be treated as a first-class citizen with respect to other responsibilities the person might have. As I said before, plan for it, and provide the mentor the time to do the job right. You have already invested in creating this mentoring relationship, whether it’s the thousands of dollars and many hours spent on hiring, or the overhead and coordination of creating a mentoring program. It’s worth continuing the investment through to[…]”

在Meta，mentorship是算作比较重要的people方面的贡献的。还有的比如带intern，做面试等等

> “Mentoring provides a great opportunity to cultivate curiosity and see the world through fresh eyes. When faced with a mentee’s questions, you can start to observe what about your organization is not so obvious to a new person. You might find areas you thought you understood but cannot explain clearly. And you’ll have the opportunity to review the assumptions you’ve collected in your time working that may be worth questioning. While many people think creativity is about seeing new things, it’s also about seeing patterns that are hidden to others. It’s hard to see patterns when the only data points you have are your own experiences. Working with new people who are learning things for the first time can shed light on these hidden patterns and help you make connections you may not otherwise have made.”

mentorship对于自己的帮助是从新人的角度重新发现系统、组的问题。因为老人已经都习惯了一些设置，即使不那么合理或是人性化。

> “The idea that the tech lead role should automatically be given to the most experienced engineer, the one who can handle the most complex features or who writes the best code, is a common misconception that even experienced managers fall for. Tech lead is not the job for the person who wants the freedom to focus deeply on the details of her own code.”

关于技术带头人（Tech Lead），一种迷思是TL就是技术最牛逼的。我的个人感受是作为TL，我可以对某个部分没有组里的一些人清楚，但我需要对整个系统有自己的概念，它什么地方是关键的，什么地方可以被优化，未来的发展方向是什么，这些需要有清楚的概念，同时也要对组里的人在做什么项目有清晰的了解，帮助每个人尽可能去做有意义、高优先级的事，了解每个人的技术优缺点，把合适的人放在合适的项目中。
