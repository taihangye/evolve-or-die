> “Engaging in the wrong type of learning. You spend too much time focused on learning about the technical part of the business and not enough about the cultural and political dimensions of your new role. You don’t build the cultural insight, relationships, and information conduits you need if you’re to understand what is really going on.

Neglecting horizontal relationships. You spend too much time focused on vertical relationships—up to the boss and down to direct reports—and not enough on peers and other stakeholders. You don’t fully understand what it will take to succeed, and you miss early opportunities to build supportive alliances.”

这里说的两个transition trap我觉得是比较容易被人忽略的。就比如做engineering manager，有些manager之前是比较强的工程师，所以到一个新的组会很偏重理解系统，而没有太关心文化、人与人的关系，信息的渠道。其次，有很多人只关心上下级，而没有注重平级的关系建设，这些人是能够在你make a big bet的时候站出来支持你的人。

> “Match your strategy to the situation. Different types of situations require you to make significant adjustments in how you plan for and execute your transition. Start-ups, for instance—of a new product, process, plant, or business—present challenges quite different from those you would face while turning around a product, process, or plant in serious trouble. A clear diagnosis of the situation is an essential prerequisite for developing your action plan.”

根据不同的情境，要采用不同的计划和策略。有些公司需要你能从无到有建立产品，有些公司需要你大量扩张并建立流程和系统去更好地管理大量招进来的人，有些公司需要你来逆转业务面对的困境，有些公司需要你在现有成功业务的基础上开发新的业务持续增长等等。

> “Secure early wins. Early wins build your credibility and create momentum. They create virtuous cycles that leverage the energy you put into the organization to create a pervasive sense that good things are happening. ”

在前几个月要赚到一些early wins，不一定是很大的成功，因为那种需要更长时间的积累，更现实的情况是一些low hanging fruits或者一些minimum viable product之类的项目，去快速建立一些个人品牌，进入一个正向的反馈。
