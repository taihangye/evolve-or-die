> “New engineering managers think of the job as a promotion, giving them seniority on engineering tasks and questions. This is a great approach for ensuring they remain junior managers, and unsuccessful leaders at that. It’s hard to accept that “new manager” is an entry-level job with no seniority on any front, but that’s the best mindset with which to start leading.”

新人经理是一个管理者的入门职位，需要有很多新的技能、思维方式需要学习，不要以为自己从高级别的技术转成经理就什么都懂。

> “We’ll talk about the main tasks required to manage people:
- Taking on a new report
- Holding regular 1-1s
- Giving feedback on career growth, progression toward goals, areas for improvement, and praise as warranted
- Working with reports to identify areas for learning and helping them grow in these areas via project work, external learning, or additional mentoring”

对于管人，有4点。招新人，周期的1：1，给职业发展的反馈，包括正向的鼓励和反面的需要成长的地方，给团队不同的人不同的机会，学习的资源以及找到职业导师。

> “Your new hire needs to understand your expectations and your style just as much as you need to understand his. You’ll each need to adjust a little bit to meet the other, but if the new hire doesn’t know what you expect from him, he can’t deliver what he needs to deliver. This expectation setting on your part should include specifics like how often you want to meet with him, how the two of you will share information, and when and how often you’ll want to review his work. If you expect him to send you a weekly summary of his progress via email, tell him. Help him understand how long he should work alone trying to solve a problem, and at what point he should ask for help. For some teams this might be an hour, and for others it might be a week.”

经理和下属之间需要有相互沟通双方的风格是怎么样的，对双方有什么期待。比如如何汇报工作，什么情况需要经理出面解决一些问题，多久见一次等等。

> “Regular 1-1s are like oil changes; if you skip them, plan to get stranded on the side of the highway at the worst possible time.”

这个比喻还挺好玩的，如果一辆车不去做保养，那就有可能在你最不想它出现问题的时候出现问题。我见过有一些经理经常换或者取消1on1，其实是一个挺不好的习惯，如果跳过一次还好，但很多情况下是经常性的，这就证明mindset里觉得1on1不重要。

> “Respect the “maker schedule” for your reports and try to give them 1-1 times that aren’t likely to be right in the middle of their productive workflow hours.”

这个沟通也很重要，不仅仅是1on1，其他的会也尽可能安排到一起，这样团队有整块的时间去专注地做事，而不是做1个小时，开半小时会，如此往复。这和manager mode不一样。其实即使是manager也需要有至少一周半天到1天的maker mode。
