> “As the manager of a process czar, help that person get more comfortable with ambiguity. As with many of the manager pitfalls, an obsession with process can be related to a fear of failure and a desire to control things to prevent the unexpected. If you are honest and make it clear that it’s safe to fail and to be imperfect, that’s often enough to get your process czar to relax a little bit and let some ambiguity in. It is very important to keep process czars from spending all of their time seeking out the perfect tool or process, and especially important to make sure that they aren’t punishing their teams for failing to follow processes.”

这还t挺有意思的。最近组里都在建设“process”比如oncall应该怎么样处理突发问题，比如组应该怎样进行项目管理等等。首先要接受没有什么流程是完美的，也没有什么流程是会被100%遵守的，要允许有错误、遗漏。

> “You’ll be involved in most major technical decisions for your team. Involved, however, is not the same thing as being the person who makes all of them alone. If you start to make all of the technical decisions without soliciting the input of your team, they’ll resent you and blame you when things go wrong. On the other hand, if you make no technical decisions and leave everything up to the team, decisions that could have been made quickly can drag on without resolution.
Determine which decisions must be made by you, which decisions should be delegated to others with more expertise, and which decisions require the whole team to resolve. In all of these cases, make it clear what the matter under discussion is, and communicate the outcome.”

作为技术领袖（或者经理），不能所有决策都是由你来做，但也不能当甩手掌柜。决定什么样的决策需要你来做，比如说未来1年要投资的重点是什么，技术要选什么样的路线等等，让团队明白这些决定背后意味着什么，你为什么这样做决定。

> “Your productivity is now less important than the productivity of the whole team. Often, this means that you pay the price of communication overhead. Instead of having every team member sit in a meeting, you represent the team, communicate their needs, and bring information from that meeting back to the team. If one universal talent separates successful leaders from the pack, it’s communication skills. Successful leaders write well, they read carefully, and they can get up in front of a group and speak. They pay attention in meetings and are constantly testing the limits of their knowledge and the knowledge of the team. Now is a great time to practice your writing and speaking skills. Write design documents and get feedback on them from better writers. Write blog posts for your tech blog or your personal blog. Speak in team meetings, speak at meetups, and get practice standing up in front of an audience.
Don’t forget to listen during all of this communication. Give others a chance to speak, and hear what they say. Practice repeating things back to people to ensure you understand them. Learn how to hear what someone says and rephrase it in your own words. If you aren’t a good note taker, you may need to become one. It doesn’t matter whether you choose to dive deep into technology, or become a manager—if you can’t communicate and listen to what other people are saying, your career growth from this point on will suffer.”

一个领袖最重要的品质之一就是沟通，
1. 学会怎么输出包括口头和笔头的，口头的可以是在会议中的发言，演讲的能力，和别人1：1的能力，笔头的包括写技术设计文档，写未来发展方向文档，写技术或者个人博客等等。
2. 学会怎么倾听。复述别人的观点来充分理解，好记性不如烂笔头，记录别人讲的事。
