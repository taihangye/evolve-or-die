title: The Psychology of Money - Timeless lesson of Wealth, Greed, and Happiness - Man in the car paradox / Wealth is what you don't see
---
> No one is impressed by your possessions as much as you are.

别总把自己当回事儿，你以为别人很羡慕你，其实你更加自恋。

> “If respect and admiration are your goal, be careful how you seek it. Humility, kindness, and empathy will bring you more respect than horsepower ever will.”

如果你想赢得尊重，那就培养好自己的品格，谦逊，与人为善，同理心能收获更多地赞美。

> “We tend to judge wealth by what we see, because that’s the information we have in front of us. We can’t see people’s bank accounts or brokerage statements. So we rely on outward appearances to gauge financial success. Cars. Homes. Instagram photos.”

通过一个人的外表去判断一个人的财富是愚蠢的。

> “Exercise is like being rich. You think, “I did the work and I now deserve to treat myself to a big meal.” Wealth is turning down that treat meal and actually burning net calories. It’s hard, and requires self-control.”

锻炼就像是赚钱，锻炼之后有些人觉得我都锻炼过了，应该奖励自己大吃一顿，那身材可能就不会变好。金钱的财富也是一样，无非是收入减去支出，不仅需要开源，还需要节流。
