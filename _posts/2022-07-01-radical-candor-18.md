> “In order to make sure they were able to understand and challenge facts as presented, leaders at Apple were expected to know details many “layers” deep in their organizations. If Steve Jobs was making an important decision and wanted to understand some aspect of it more deeply, he’d go right to the person working on it. There were numerous stories about relatively new, young engineers who’d return from lunch to find Steve waiting in their cube, eager to ask them about a specific detail of their work. He didn’t get this information filtered to him through the person’s boss or through the person’s boss’s recommendation; he went straight to the source. The more often you can do that, the more empowered your whole organization feels.”

作为boss，在要做决策的时候，如果需要什么信息，不能只是做filter，而是直接去看信息源，talk to people。

> “Most people expect that the “logic” part of persuasion will be easiest, since it doesn’t present the personal awkwardness of establishing credibility or require the psychological finesse of addressing the collective emotions of a group of people. And yet it contains its own traps. Sometimes, the logic may seem self-evident to you, so you fail to share it with others. When you know something deeply, it’s hard to remember that others don’t.
The good news is that you learned the secret to sharing your logic in high school math class: show your work. When Steve Jobs had an idea, he wouldn’t just describe the idea; he’d share how he got to it. He showed his work. This signaled that if there was a flaw in his reasoning, he wanted to know about it. And if there wasn’t, people would be more likely to accept his idea. Showing his work was what strengthened his logic and ultimately made him not only persuasive but “always getting it right.”

不仅讲结论，更要说明你得出结论的逻辑线条和过程，这样别人更容易接受或者挑战你（更好地提高你的决策）

> “AS THE BOSS, part of your job is to take a lot of the “collaboration tax” on yourself so that your team can spend more time executing. The responsibilities you have as a boss take up a tremendous amount of time. One of the hardest things about being a boss is balancing these responsibilities with the work you need to do personally in your area of expertise.
Here are the three things I’ve learned about getting this balance right: Don’t waste your team’s time; Keep the “dirt under your fingernails”; and Block time to execute.”

> “you need to learn to toggle between leading and executing personally. Don’t abandon the first for the second; integrate the two. If you get too far away from the work your team is doing, you won’t understand their ideas well enough to help them clarify, to participate in debates, to know which decisions to push them to make, to teach them to be more persuasive. The GSD wheel will grind to a halt if you don’t understand intimately the “stuff” your team is trying to get done.”

作为boss要做的几件事，把合作的tax更多地承担下来，帮助团队connect以及节省时间更多的执行；同时自己要能够理解一些detail，否则没有办法challenge团队帮助团队clarify；最后要block足够的时间自己执行一些事，可以是熟悉技术，可以向未来的发展方向，可以是着手解决目前最重要项目的blocker等等
