            "content": "“A couple of months after joining Google, I had a disagreement with Larry Page about his approach to a policy. In a fit of frustration, I sent an email to about thirty people, including Larry, which said, “Larry claims he wants to organize the world’s information, but his policy is creating ‘clutter sites,’ muddling the world’s information.” I went on to imply that he was recommending the policy because he was focused on increasing Google’s revenue rather than doing the right thing for users.” . “The incident with Larry is a good example of how criticism can be obnoxiously aggressive if you don’t care personally. I probably thought I was being Radically Candid—“speaking truth to power”—but I wasn’t. It was a clear-cut case of “front-stabbing.” Better than backstabbing, but still really bad. The first problem with my email was that it wasn’t humble. I had just joined the company, and I didn’t understand much about how Google’s systems worked. Nor had I bothered to find out why Larry might be taking the stance he was taking. Instead, I just made a bunch of assumptions and concluded—wrongly, as it turned out—that Larry was more concerned with making money than he was with Google’s mission. Furthermore, my suggestions were not at all helpful because I didn’t fully understand the underlying issue that Larry was trying to address. My other miscalculation was criticizing Larry in a public forum, rather than in private, which would have been the respectful thing to do. And worst of all, I personalized. I should have been talking about the AdSense policy, but instead I attacked Larry’s character, implicitly accusing him of being greedy and hypocritical. As I would see over and over in the next six years at Google, Larry was certainly neither of those things. He was fair and consistent. But the point here is that I shouldn’t have been talking about Larry’s character, either positively or negatively. I was personalizing.” . 这里说了和larry page的一个故事，作者在不了解整个背景的情况下，公开的发email指责larry本人虚伪和贪婪。作者说这是典型的Obnoxiously aggressive criticism . 作者刚加入google不久，对整个事情没有详细的了解，也不知道google是怎么样工作的 | 对于批评最好是私下里先进行 | 对于指责的本身没有专注于事情，而是说别人的品格。 | “MANIPULATIVELY INSINCERE GUIDANCE happens when you don’t care enough about a person to challenge directly. People give praise and criticism that is manipulatively insincere when they are too focused on being liked or think they can gain some sort of political advantage by being fake—or when they are just too tired to care or argue any more. Guidance that is manipulatively insincere rarely reflects what the speaker actually thinks; rather, it’s an attempt to push the other person’s emotional buttons in return for some personal gain. “He’ll be happy if I tell him I liked his stupid presentation, and that will make my life easier than explaining why it sucked. In the long run, though, I really need to find someone to replace him.” . 对于MANIPULATIVELY INSINCERE，基本上就是 . 想着自己怎么得到别人的好感而不是真正帮助别人，表里不一 | 完全没有精力和想法去帮助他人，但又不愿意去真实地表达这一点 | “That’s why Colin Powell said leadership is sometimes about being willing to piss people off. When you are overly worried about how people will perceive you, you’re less willing to say what needs to be said. Like Jony, you may feel it’s because you care about the team, but really, in those all-too-human moments you may care too much about how they feel about you—in other words, about yourself. I’ve been there, too. We all have.” . 作为领导者，不能总想着别人对你的感受，而是怎么让团队做好。想着别人对你的感受，其实就只是在关心你自己。 .",

Even though the overall talk had gone well, she didn’t let the positive result get in the way of pointing out something I needed to fix. She did so immediately, so that the problem didn’t hurt my reputation at Google. She made sure to point out the positive things I’d accomplished in the presentation, and what’s more, she did so thoroughly and sincerely—there was no attempt at “sandwiching” the criticism between bogus positives. Her first approach was gentle but direct. When it became clear that I wasn’t hearing her, she became more direct, but even then she was careful not to “personalize,” not to make it about some essential trait. She said I “sounded” stupid rather than I was stupid. And I wasn’t in this alone: she offered tangible help. I didn’t feel like an idiot with defects, but a valuable team member she was ready to invest in. But it still stung a little bit.” . 及时的正面肯定，以及指出可以提高的地方，确定对方明白自己的意思，并有可能的情况下提供实质的帮助 . “There are two dimensions to good guidance: care personally and challenge directly. As discussed in chapter one, when you do both at the same time, it’s Radical Candor. It’s also useful to be clear about what happens when you fail in one dimension (Ruinous Empathy), the other (Obnoxious Aggression), or both (Manipulative Insincerity). Being clear about what happens when you fail to care personally or challenge directly will help you avoid backsliding into old habits too common to all of us. ” . . “WHEN YOU CRITICIZE someone without taking even two seconds to show you care, your guidance feels obnoxiously aggressive to the recipient. I regret to say that if you can’t be Radically Candid, being obnoxiously aggressive is the second best thing you can do. At least then people know what you think and where they stand, so your team can achieve results. This explains the advantage that assholes seem to have in the world. Let me be clear. I refuse to work with people who can’t be bothered to show basic human decency. I want you to keep your humanity intact. If more people can be Radically Candid, there will be less reason to tolerate Obnoxious Aggression.” . 如果同时做到关心他人的感受和直接挑战很难的话，第二好的选择是直接挑战。 .",

            "content": "“Challenging others and encouraging them to challenge you helps build trusting relationships because it shows 1) you care enough to point out both the things that aren’t going well and those that are and that 2) you are willing to admit when you’re wrong and that you are committed to fixing mistakes that you or others have made. But because challenging often involves disagreeing or saying no, this approach embraces conflict rather than avoiding it. Former Secretary of State Colin Powell once remarked that being responsible sometimes means pissing people off. 4 You have to accept that sometimes people on your team will be mad at you. In fact, if nobody is ever mad at you, you probably aren’t challenging your team enough. The key, as in any relationship, is how you handle the anger. When what you say hurts, acknowledge the other person’s pain. Don’t pretend it doesn’t hurt or say it “shouldn’t” hurt—just show that you care. Eliminate the phrase “don’t take it personally” from your vocabulary—it’s insulting. Instead, offer to help fix the problem.” . 当提出表扬或是问题时，我们需要承认会对对方的情感造成影响，但不能因为害怕对对方的情感造成伤害，就不去提出问题，而是应该帮助他去解决问题。 . “WE TALKED ABOUT the importance of humility. Radical Candor is not a license to be gratuitously harsh or to “front-stab.” . 当然Radical candor不是说你可以不考虑方式地去说。 . “Radical Candor is also not an invitation to nitpick. Challenging people directly takes real energy—not only from the people you’re challenging but from you as well. So do it only for things that really matter. A good rule of thumb for any relationship is to leave three unimportant things unsaid each day. . Radical Candor is not a hierarchical thing. To be Radically Candid, you need to practice it “up,” “down,” and “sideways.” Even if your boss and peers have not bought in to this method, you CAN create a Radically Candid microcosm for yourself and the people on your team. You are entitled to proceed with a little more caution with your boss and your peers. But ultimately, if it’s not possible to be Radically Candid with your boss and your peers, I’d recommend finding a different kind of work environment if at all possible. . Radical candor也不是鸡蛋里挑骨头。同时也要对上级，平级和下级都保持Radical candor（当然要注意方法）。 . “BOTH DIMENSIONS OF Radical Candor are sensitive to context. They get measured at the listener’s ear, not at the speaker’s mouth. Radical Candor is not a personality type or a talent or a cultural judgment. Radical Candor works only if the other person understands that your efforts at caring personally and challenging directly are delivered in good faith.” . 很多人觉得自己好心提醒，为什么对方就是不接受，甚至要反击。可能是没有注意方式方法，如果你提出的意见对方不接受，那本身就是没有效果的，不管你是不是真正关心以及处于好心，得想办法让对方知道你是出于好心，并且用对方能够接受和理解方式让他明白你的用意 .",

            "content": "“The first dimension is about being more than “just professional.” It’s about giving a damn, sharing more than just your work self, and encouraging everyone who reports to you to do the same. It’s not enough to care only about people’s ability to perform a job. To have a good relationship, you have to be your whole self and care about each of the people who work for you as a human being. It’s not just business; it is personal, and deeply personal. I call this dimension “Care Personally.” . “The second dimension involves telling people when their work isn’t good enough—and when it is; when they are not going to get that new role they wanted, or when you’re going to hire a new boss “over” them; when the results don’t justify further investment in what they’re working on. Delivering hard feedback, making hard calls about who does what on a team, and holding a high bar for results—isn’t that obviously the job of any manager? But most people struggle with doing these things. Challenging people generally pisses them off, and at first that doesn’t seem like a good way to build a relationship or to show that you “care personally.” And yet challenging people is often the best way to show them that you care when you’re the boss. This dimension I call “Challenge Directly.” “Radical Candor” is what happens when you put “Care Personally” and “Challenge Directly” together.” . 真正的关心团队中的人，不仅仅是他的工作。同时会很真实地反应每个人的表现，提出挑战性的问题。 . “Part of the reason why people fail to “care personally” is the injunction to “keep it professional.” That phrase denies something essential. We are all human beings, with human feelings, and, even at work, we need to be seen as such. When that doesn’t happen, when we feel we must repress who we really are to earn a living, we become alienated. ” . 关于异化，即使在工作中，我们也是一个完整的人，如果一份工作需要疯狂地压抑自己的本性，去表现得非常“专业”，那这份工作本身以及环境是非常有问题的。 . “Fred Kofman, my coach at Google, had a mantra that contradicted the “just professional” approach so destructive to so many managers: “Bring your whole self to work.” This saying has become a meme; Google it and you’ll get more than eight million results. Sheryl Sandberg referred to it in her 2012 commencement address at Harvard, author Mike Robbins devoted a TEDx talk to it in 2016, and Stewart Butterfield, Slack’s CEO, has made it a priority for his company. Bringing your whole self to work is one of those concepts that’s hard to define precisely, but you develop a feel for it when you start to open up to it. This often means modeling the behavior yourself by showing some vulnerability to the people who report to you—or just admitting when you’re having a bad day—and creating a safe space for others to do the same.” . 分享自己的脆弱，让别人也能很安全地分享。 . “Being the boss can feel like a lonely one-way street at times—especially at first. That is OK. If you can absorb the blows, the members of your team are more likely to be good bosses to their employees, when they have them. Once people know what it feels like to have a good boss, it’s more natural for them to want to be a good boss. They may never repay you, but they are likely to pay it forward. The rewards of watching people you care about flourish and then help others flourish are enormous.” . 成为一个好老板是孤独的，但当你的下属也成为老板时，他会把你的那些好的方法用在他的下属身上。 .",

They determine whether you can fulfill your three responsibilities as a manager: 1) to create a culture of guidance (praise and criticism) that will keep everyone moving in the right direction; 2) to understand what motivates each person on your team well enough to avoid burnout or boredom and keep the team cohesive; and 3) to drive results collaboratively. If you think that you can do these things without strong relationships, you are kidding yourself.” . “There is a virtuous cycle between your responsibilities and your relationships. You strengthen your relationships by learning the best ways to get, give, and encourage guidance; by putting the right people in the right roles on your team; and by achieving results collectively that you couldn’t dream of individually. Of course, there can be a vicious cycle between your responsibilities and your relationships, too. When you fail to give people the guidance they need to succeed in their work, or put people into roles they don’t want or aren’t well-suited for, or push people to achieve results they feel are unrealistic, you erode trust.” . “Your relationships with your direct reports affect the relationships they have with their direct reports, and your team’s culture.

            "content": "“I have some quibbles with that. Employees with obligations that take them out of the office at a strict time every day are no more or less engaged than those who are willing to stand around and chat. The larger point, however, is still a good one. Most gelled teams have a sense of camaraderie that makes them joke together, get coffee, share lunch, and feel friendly toward one another. They may have obligations they respect, and passions outside of work, but they don’t view their team as something they’re eager to escape every day. The real goal here is psychological safety—that is, a team whose members are willing to take risks and make mistakes in front of one another. This is the underpinning of a successful team. The work of gelling a team begins by creating the friendliness that leads to psychological safety. You can encourage this by taking the time to get to know people as human beings and asking them about their extracurricular lives and interests. Let them share what they feel comfortable sharing. Ask how their child’s birthday party went, how their ski trip was, how their marathon training is going. This is more than empty small talk; it fosters relatedness, the sense of people as individuals and not just anonymous cogs.” . 不同的人完全可以有不同的工作时间和社交风格，有些人喜欢和同事社交，有些人更喜欢回家。但要建立的是作为一个团队，大家都能够安心的犯错，能够适度的关心对方的工作和生活，作为团队中的一个人而不是一个机器中的一颗螺丝。 . “Beyond you personally cultivating relatedness, you want your teams to have their own relatedness among themselves. When companies talk about hiring for “culture fit,” they often mean they want to hire people they can be friendly with. While this can have some unwanted consequences, such as discrimination, it comes from a wise place. Teams that are friendly are happier, gel faster, and tend to produce better results. I mean, do you really want to go to work every day with a bunch of people you hate? This is why those who undermine team cohesion are so problematic. They almost always behave in a way that makes it hard for the rest of the team to feel safe around them. We refer to these employees as “toxic” because they tend to make everyone who comes into contact with them less effective. Dealing with them quickly is an important part of managing well.” . 团队文化是从每天的行为中体现出来的，而不是挂在墙上的标语。如果大家工作中都互相争夺功劳，那即使倡导团队协作也只不过是空话。同时要注意的是如果某些人对团队文化和士气起到了很大负面作用的话，要及时采取行动。 . “The best way to avoid brilliant jerk syndrome is to simply not hire one. Once they’re hired, getting rid of brilliant jerks takes a level of management confidence that I think is uncommon. Fortunately, these folks will often get rid of themselves, because even though you may not have the guts to fire them, it’s unlikely that you’ll be stupid enough to promote them. Right? Let’s hope so.” . “The best thing you can do for your team, in the context of having a brilliant jerk, is to simply and openly refuse to tolerate bad behavior. This may be one of the few instances where “praise in public, criticize in private” is upended. When a person is behaving badly in a way that is having a visible impact on the team, and a way you don’t want your culture to mimic, you need to say something in the moment to make the standard clear. “Please do not speak to people that way; it is disrespectful.” You’ll want to have tight control of your own reaction because delivering this in public is walking a fine line. If you seem emotional, it may undermine you. The offender may write off your feedback as just emotion, or you may come off as picking on the person. Keep the feedback neutral but to the point if you are going to deliver it in the moment, in public. Note that this approach should only be used for behavior you feel is detrimental to the whole group. If you just think the person is undermining you personally, discuss it in private. Your first goal is to protect your team as a whole, the second is to protect each individual on the team, and your last priority is protecting yourself.” . 这是很好的建议。对整体有负面影响的时候要及时当场制止，而且要就是论事，如果对团队某个人有影响的时候，也要当场制止，但对自己的时候可以考虑私下聊。 .",

It’s natural and perfectly human to want to be liked by other people. Many of us believe that the way to be liked is to be seen as nice—that niceness is itself the goal. Your goal as a manager, however, should not be to be nice, it should be to be kind. “Nice” is the language of polite society, where you’re trying to get along with strangers or acquaintances. Nice is saying “please” and “thank you” and holding doors for people struggling with bags or strollers. Nice is saying “I’m fine” when asked how you are, instead of “I’m in a really crappy mood and I wish you would leave me alone.” Nice is a good thing in casual conversation. But as a manager, you will have relationships that go deeper, and it’s more important to be kind. It’s kind to tell someone who isn’t ready for promotion that she isn’t ready, and back that up with the work she needs to do to get there. It’s unkind to lead that person on, saying “Maybe you could get promoted,” and then watch her fail. It’s kind to tell someone that his behavior in meetings is disrupting the group. It’s awkward, and uncomfortable, but it’s also part of your job as his manager to have these difficult conversations.” . 作为经理，不能做老好人“nice”，而是实事求是的做反馈，并提高明确的要求，以及一定的指导。 .",

These people loved their work and were world-class at it, but they didn’t want her job or to be Steve Jobs. They were happy where they were. The people who were on a steeper growth trajectory—the ones who’d go crazy if they were still doing the same job in a year—she called “superstars.” They were the source of growth on any team. She was explicit about needing a balance of both” . 一个团队既需要有稳定的输出者Rock star，也需要有成长型的人Super star。 . “At Apple, as at Google, a boss’s ability to achieve results had a lot more to do with listening and seeking to understand than it did with telling people what to do; more to do with debating than directing; more to do with pushing people to decide than with being the decider; more to do with persuading than with giving orders; more to do with learning than with knowing.” . 团队的领导者更多要倾听而不是发号施令，更多的讨论和引导大的方向而不是所有决定都要经手，尽可能多的去说服而不是命令，更多地去学习而不是满足于已经知道的。 . “No, the reason why Silicon Valley turned out to be a good place to study the relationships between bosses and the people who report to them is that the war for “talent” there is intense . So many great companies in the Valley are growing and hiring that there’s no reason to stay with a company if you are unhappy or think your potential is being wasted. And there’s certainly no reason to pay the “asshole tax.” If you don’t like your boss, you quit, knowing that ten other companies will be lining up to hire you.

Or, to put it another way, helping them understand the key important goals and focusing them on those goals is important. However, it’s unrealistic to expect that you can or should shield your team from everything. Sometimes it’s appropriate to let some of the stress through to the team. The goal is not to stress them out, but to help them get context into what they’re dealing with. The extreme shielders think they can best focus and motivate their teams by giving clear goals. But humans usually need some sort of context into why these goals have been set, and thereby into what problems they’re working to solve. If you’re going to have operational issues in November if a particular system isn’t up and running, your team deserves to understand that consequence. Appropriate context is what helps teams make good decisions about how and where to focus their energy.

The nature of leadership is that, while you may only have the authority to guide decisions rather than dictate them, you’ll still be judged by how well those decisions turn out.” . “Create a Data-Driven Team Culture: These efficiency and technical data points can be used to evaluate decisions on both product features and technical changes.” . “Flex Your Own Product Muscles: Developing customer empathy will also help you figure out which areas of the technology have the greatest direct impact on your customers, and that understanding will guide where you invest engineering effort.” . “Look into the future: You need to think two steps ahead, from a product and technology perspective. Getting a sense of where the product roadmap is going helps you guide the technical roadmap. Many technical projects are supported on the strength of their ability to enable new features more easily” . “Review the Outcome of Your Decisions and Projects: Talk about whether the hypotheses you used to motivate projects actually turned out to be true. Was it true that the team moved faster after you rewrote that system? Did customer behavior change in the way the product team predicted when you added the new feature? What have you learned from your A/B tests? It’s easy to forget to review assumptions after the project is done, but if you make this a habit for yourself and your team, you’ll always learn from your decisions.” . “Run Retrospectives for the Processes and Day-to-Day: Whether you work in an agile methodology or some other fashion, the regular process retrospective has a lot of value for detecting patterns and forcing a reckoning with the outcome of decisions. Is the team feeling good about how they get requirements? Do they feel good about the code quality? This process helps you learn how the decisions you make over time affect the way your team operates in the day-to-day. This approach is more subjective than gathering data about the team’s health, but it’s arguably even more valuable than many objective measures, because it comes from the things the team itself is noticing and struggling with or celebrating.” .",

            "content": "“The negative person is easier to deal with than the brilliant jerk. Make it clear to him that the behavior has to change, bring clear examples, and provide corrective feedback quickly after things happen. Sometimes the negative person is just unhappy and the best thing to do is to help him leave the team on good terms; you must be prepared for this outcome. Other times, the person has no idea about the impact he’s having on the team, and a quick chat will be all that’s needed to curtail the incidents. Be careful that vocally negative people don’t stay in that mindset on your team for long. The kind of toxic drama that is created by these energy vampires is hard for even the best manager to combat. The best defense is a good offense in this case, and quick action is essential.” . 这个确实很重要，一个人的一些问题会影响到周围和他接触的人，甚至整个组，需要即使应对。 . “Ask the CTO: Managing a Former Peer I just got promoted to run my team over another peer of mine, a senior engineer who also wanted the job. How can I make sure to manage this so that I don’t alienate him while still taking on the role? . This experience can be deeply awkward, so the first thing to do is to acknowledge that. If you’re now managing someone who was truly your peer, acknowledge the weirdness of the transition. Be honest and transparent with this person that you’re going to do the best job you can, but you’ll need his help to do it. You need him to be honest with you about the things that are going well and the things that are not. You’re going to have to be a little bit vulnerable with him, because you won’t be perfect the first time around. . Next, remember that your job has changed in some big ways. As his manager, you may now have the ability to override his decisions, but use this power very cautiously. Using your managerial power to override technical decisions is usually a bad idea. Resist the temptation to micromanage people—especially those who used to be your peers. They’re going to be sensitive to the feeling that you’ve been “rewarded,” even if they didn’t want to become managers themselves. If you question their every move and try to make every single decision yourself, you’ll make this sensitivity much worse. . A corollary here is that you’re going to have to let go of some of your previous work as you ease into the additional responsibilities of people management. Every step up the management chain will mean adding new responsibilities and giving up some of your old ones. You can use this situation to your advantage with former peers by openly giving them more control over some of that technical work you used to own. This is also an opportunity to give new challenges to more junior members of the team. While many engineering organizations want first-level managers to continue to write some code, they likely expect the code those managers write to be smaller features, bug fixes, and enhancements, rather than deep new systems.” . Throughout all of this change, your goal is to show the team that you’re committed to helping them succeed. Your new role isn’t taking anything away from the rest of the team; it’s only giving you some new responsibilities that either were being neglected or used to belong to someone else, and shifting some of your old responsibilities to other members of the team.” . 这个是我目前要面对的问题。自己对于技术的责任要移交出去一部分，以及怎么和之前的peer相处，虽然我的情况简单很多，因为之前半年到一年我就是一直扮演着TL的角色，只是现在需要负责他们的performance review以及对整个组负责而已。 .",

He’s been with the company for a couple of years and done OK work, but I don’t think he has the potential to be promoted further on our team. Every time he asks what he needs to do to get to the next level, I tell him, but he then goes back to his comfort zone, and no amount of nudging seems to bring about any change. What should I do? This is a fairly common occurrence that managers have to handle. You have an employee who has topped out in the organization and seems to be losing energy. He has achieved expectations in his level, but can’t figure out how to grow enough to get to the next level, despite your efforts. It may be time to coach him out. Many organizations have a rule of “up or out” for early-career employees. The entry levels of most engineering career ladders expect that people at those levels will progress within a certain period of time, and if they don’t, they aren’t meeting expectations and will be fired. Generally, you want to make sure that long-term employees are capable of doing their day-to-day work independently, without a lot of oversight or help. However, once people have gotten past these up-or-out career points, what do you do when they get stuck? Some people will be happy cruising as senior engineers or managers at a certain level for their whole careers, and if you’re both satisfied with the work, there’s nothing wrong with that. Others, like your employee, want to progress but for whatever reason don’t seem to be able to do it on your team. You owe it to your employee to be clear that this is the case. This is what is meant by “coaching out.” Make the situation clear to him. You have told him repeatedly what the next level looks like, and he has not been able to show that he can work at that level, so you don’t think that your team is the right place for him to grow his career. You aren’t firing him, but you are telling him that he needs to move on if he wants to progress. Give the employee a chance to find a job in another part of the organization or at another company. When he does, let him go happily, and do your best to retain goodwill. Former couples who break up because they don’t see a future together can remain friends, and the same goes for former employees who simply need a different team or company to shine.” . 这个回答很全面了。 . 对于up-or-out的新人来说，fb就是3到4最多24个月，4到5最多33个月。会有yellow zone，red zone一说。这种时候需要非常明确这个问题。 | 对于已经到senior能够独立完成任务的员工来说分成两种情况 a. 不想继续升职，可以很好的完成任务，那不需要强求继续成长 b. 想继续升职，但要么组里没有足够的空间，或者他不知道什么原因就是没有办法在这个组成长到他想要的程度。这种情况就可以让他看看其他机会（内部转组比如infra转product，或者跳槽） | “The engineering lead will spend less time writing code, but they still engage in small technical deliverables, such as bug fixes and small features, without blocking or slowing down the progress of their team. More than writing code, they hold responsibility for identifying bottlenecks in the process and roadblocks to success for their team and clearing these roadblocks. The person who fills this role is expected to have a large impact on the success of [the organization] as a whole. In particular, leaders in this role are capable of identifying the most high-value projects and keeping their team focused on these projects. As part of keeping the team focused, the engineering lead will partner closely with the product lead to manage project scope and ensure the technical deliverables are met. In addition to focusing the team, they are capable of identifying headcount needs for the team and planning and recruiting to fill these needs. The engineering lead is an independent manager. They are comfortable managing team members with different skill sets from their own. They communicate expectations clearly to all team members, and solicit and deliver individual feedback frequently (not just in the scope of review periods). In addition to strong management skills, the engineering lead acts as a leader for the technical roadmap for their product group (pillar). They clearly communicate the timeline, scope, and risks to their pillar partners, and lead the delivery of major initiatives on clear timelines. Additionally, they identify areas of strategic technical debt, do the cost/benefit analysis for resolving this debt, and communicate suggested timelines for prioritizing this to the management team.” . 对一线经理的jd。有足够的技术能力可以发现瓶颈和路障，对组织的成功负责，有愿景和可执行的计划，知道如何平衡新需求和换技术宅。 .",

This goes not only for the writing process but also—and especially—for the delivery. Don’t let people skip over the good stuff in order to obsess over the areas for improvement, as many will want to do. Those strengths are what you’ll use to determine when people should be promoted, and it is important to write them down and reflect on them.” . 不仅要赞扬每个人做得好的地方，还要记录下来具体的事情，可以为升职做记录。 . “More often, you’ll get a lot of scattershot feedback that’s moderately helpful at best. Some people will seem to be reaching for something to say, and others will have a particularly harsh impression that no one else seems to share. Especially in the case of scattershot feedback, make sure that the feedback you’re seeing makes sense before you deliver it. For example, if only one reviewer mentions sloppy work, is the problem that the work is sloppy, or that the reviewer has higher standards than the rest of the team? Use your judgment in this case. If the feedback seems valuable for the person to hear, share it, but don’t just blindly report all grudges.” . 对于你的下属，听到别人对他的评价，不能全部接受，要思考它有没有提供具体的例子，以及这个评价者的标准是不是适中，既不太严格也不太松。 . “As you learn how to play the game, I encourage you to be fairly transparent with your team. When members express the desire to be promoted and they don’t have a strong case for promotion, telling them what goes into the process will help them understand what they may need to change. You should also prepare yourself to start identifying promotion-worthy projects and trying to give those projects to people who are close to promotion. You, as the manager, are in a good position to identify what’s coming up for the team. Depending on how work gets assigned, you may either directly assign these projects to people, or encourage people to volunteer for projects that are a stretch goal for them. Keep an eye out for opportunities for your team members to stretch themselves and grow.” . 对升职来说，当一个经理知道了应该怎么做才能获得升职，那就应该和组里的成员，尤其是能力比较靠近下一个等级的成员分享。让他们能关注差距在哪，并且有机会通过项目和具体的案例去弥补。 . “Upon hearing that someone is underperforming, many companies will have you write the person a document called a performance improvement plan. This is a set of clearly defined objectives that the person must achieve within a fixed period of time. If she manages to achieve them, then she is taken off the plan and all is well; otherwise, she’s fired. Depending on the company, such a plan might actually be an effort to turn an employee around, but often the plan is written in such a way that the person can’t possibly hope to achieve the goals in the allotted time, and it’s just a generous way of giving someone time to look for another job before being fired. Whatever the procedure is at your company, the process of coaching someone out should begin long before any performance improvement document is filed with HR, and long before the actual act of firing. One of the basic rules of management is the rule of no surprises, particularly negative ones. You need to understand what a person is supposed to be giving you, and if that isn’t happening, make it clear to her early and often that she is not meeting expectations.” . “This situation is why you start giving feedback early and often, and keep records of the feedback you’ve been delivering. Feedback, positive or negative, should be a conversation. If you avoid tackling negative feedback until it builds to a boiling point, you’re going to be met by a pile of excuses, and then what do you do? Some managers will ignore the excuses at their peril, and lose employee after employee to an unwelcoming team that fails to onboard, coach, and give clear goals to employees. On the other hand, some managers will accept any excuse until problems can no longer be swept under the rug, and the team is furious at management’s inaction with regard to the lagging employee. You’ll always need to have a record of negative feedback to fire someone in any environment where HR is active and a standard performance improvement plan is required. If you have no HR, I suggest that you still give people clear improvement feedback in writing, with a timeline for improvement, and have them acknowledge it in writing as well (email is OK). Not only does this protect you legally, but it helps you treat your employees fairly.” . 对于硅谷这边的公司来说基本都有pip/dev list之类的program，一般来说收到的人大概率是会跳槽的。但作为经理应该尽早给反馈，并帮助他提高，而不是either不给反馈突然打个措手不及，或者完全不管对方的理由，比如身体原因，家庭原因等等。 .",

You don’t have to do this in public, but every week there should be at least one thing you can recognize about someone on your team. Even better, look for something to recognize weekly for everyone who reports to you.” . 我们现在的周会都会列出对better engineering相关的贡献，因为是infra组，所以强调这方面的贡献还是很有必要的，这样大家会更有动力，并知道做相关的项目会得到好的回报（至少和新feature差不多）。 . “Why do I list coaching as a bonus? It’s not always a core need for doing the job well, and there will be many times when you don’t have either the qualifications or the capability to provide the coaching that everyone on your team needs. Coaching is most important for your early-career team members, or those who have the potential or desire for advancement. Many people will be content with doing the job they know how to do well, and as long as they are doing it well enough, it’s not a good use of your time to try to coach them. Save your valuable coaching time for those who are receptive to it.” . 这段话很关键，不是所有人都想要升职或者提高技能的，这个和radical candor一书里的super star (steep growth trajectory+excellent performance at the current position)和rock star (gradual growth trajectory+excellent performance at the current position)很类似。作为经理你也不可能全能,对于相对经验比较少的人可以提供一定的指导。 . “Try to account for the whole year, not just the past couple of months This will be easier if you keep notes on what has happened with each person throughout the year. One tactic is to keep a running summary of your 1-1s, including any feedback that was delivered. If you haven’t done this, I encourage you to look through your email to remember which projects launched, review what activities were happening month by month, and put yourself back into the perspective of that time period. The goal for viewing the whole year is to recognize not just early accomplishments but also the growth and change you’ve seen since then.” . 做review不是年底的事，平时就要记录。 . “If you can’t use a concrete example to support a point, ask yourself if the point is something you should be communicating in the review. Forcing yourself to be specific will steer you away from writing reviews based on underlying bias.” . 不要仅仅靠记忆或者感觉。要提供具体的事实，没有的话就去找，找不到就不要写这点。 .",

            "content": "《读书日谈读书》是翟东升老师在b站上写的一篇文章，里面谈了他是如何选书、读书以及突破书本身的牢笼的。读下来感觉有不少观点是和我自己的感受有类似的地方的。 . 第一，读书的内容上要杂，要跨学科。要用跨学科的视角去理解这个世界，因为真实世界的运转不是天然区分为经济、政治、社会、军事这些方面的，这种学科区分是人为的。书中记载的是别人的思想，别人的思想既是我们的脚手架，也是我们的牢笼。越是著名的人物所写的书，对我们的束缚也就越严重。当我们同时阅读不同学科背景的著名大家写的书籍时，就如同这些大家名人在我们眼前展开辩论，这样我们就能够看出这些大人物们各自的局限来。 . 这和我目前的看书习惯比较类似，主要是看技术、管理、投资类的书最多，哲学、个人成长次之，历史、经济、政治、传记、小说较少。 . 其次，尽量多读难度之书，要啃大部头。要想提升自己的认识水平，如果你发现手头的书读起来很轻松，那说明这位作者的认知水平与你差不多，甚至还不如你，那你就翻一翻前言导论和结论就行了，最多化半小时，千万别在这类书上浪费太多时间。我读本科硕士的时候，经常在人民大学的图书馆里翻书，翻翻目录，看看前言和结论。要想实质性提升你的思维水平，那就必须读那些让你挠头打瞌睡的大部头的书。你读书打瞌睡不是因为你懒惰，而是因为你手中的书烧脑，读得快了容易大脑缺氧，就感觉困了。 . 目前看哲学类的书会相对比较累，我觉得不需要所有书都是烧脑的，可以主要读有符合目前水平的书，需要用一些力气去思考但不需要很累，以及稍微超出一点的书，可以不断拓展阅读边界以及深度。但不需要一下子就看很难的或者是完全不想关的书。 . 其三，对于有志于学术生涯的硕士生博士生而言，“不动笔墨不看书”是很好的建议。我通常的做法是，如果是跟我的研究有关的阅读，每打开一本书，我会准备好笔和巴掌大的黄色贴纸做笔记摘抄。书上有触动我的段落，我会标示一下，然后把我自己的所思所想写在贴纸上，直接贴到书中相关位置上。读完整本书之后，我才会打开电脑，建立一个单独的文档，写上书的作者和出版信息，然后按照页码，把需要摘抄的内容敲进电脑；再另起一段，注明“翟：”，然后把贴纸上的内容敲进电脑里。这样，一本书读完，我会积累下一个数千乃至一万多字的文档，其中一半是书中值得引用的文字，另一半是我自己的所思所想。 . 这和我现在的做法基本相同。我是主要看电子版的，所以第一遍会用记号笔划重点，然后读完后进行总结，加上自己的一些想法。放到自己的博客中。 . 那么，为什么看书的时候不在电脑上直接看电子版，记录的时候直接拷贝下来呢？也许别人可以这么做，但是我自己的经验教训是，只要电脑手机在手边，我就容易分神，容易去网上瞎转。因为我为写东西搞研究而读的书都不是令我爱不释手的书，有许多是让人心烦意乱大脑疲劳的书，必须有意识地平心静气才能读完，所以我常常是把手机和电脑扔在家里，自己拿了书拿了纸和笔跑到咖啡厅里带上耳塞读学术书。所以，我通常只读纸质书，论文也尽量打印出来再读，此为四。 . 这个确实是会所影响，但目前我可以基本养成习惯在电脑上看书的时间段是不会去看其他娱乐的东西了。 . 第五，上了大学之后，一定要学会带着怀疑和批判精神去读书。古人说，尽信书不如无书。 . 这个也是很赞同的，首先每个作者的观点都是受限于当时的时空以及个人经历的限制的。直接生搬硬套肯定是有问题的。同时读了同个领域，或者交叉领域的书后，其实有些观点自然会被加强或者证伪。 . 最后，我自己读书还有一个特点，读完了书很容易忘。我记性不算差，也不算很强。有的同学、同事可以做到过目不忘，对于谁谁谁在哪年写了什么文章其中有什么观点，他们能记得一清二楚，梳理得头头是道。我的思维方式似乎天生就不是这样的，也不喜欢记忆这些东西。多数情况下我喜欢翻书，有一些领域是一本书里包含百本书的，比如我本科时花了一个学期业余读完了两本姐妹书：《百位西方哲学大师》《百位中国哲学大师》，书名我记不太确切了，内容也记不住太多，但是那两本书的确让我迅速概览了东西方哲学思想的全貌。只有少数书我是认真精读的，但即便是精读的书，我也很快就忘了作者叫啥，具体写了啥。我记得住的通常是这本书里有啥特别有启发的观点。时间长了之后，连书名和是否真的深读过我都忘了。但是我自己提出的对某些问题的分析和解释框架，许多同事或者学生会提醒我，你这个想法是谁谁谁的原创但是被你篡改了，你那个观点似乎有哪本书哪派人的影子。李连杰演的电影里，张三丰临阵磨枪地教张无忌太极拳，学着学着徒弟忘了招了，师傅竟然说忘了招才说明你学对了。我看书与之类似，常常是得其意而忘其言。我再输出的时候，就是我自己重新融合创新的一套概念和逻辑了。我原本以为这是我的某种缺点，但是后来接触到一位一辈子研究智力的老先生，他的说法是，记忆力是智力的基础部分，概括抽象能力、数字计算能力、空间想象能力和逻辑推理能力等等则是其中间部分，但高阶而且更稀缺的智力是创造性想象力，也就是能凭空想象出从未有过之事物。经过他这么一说，我就对自己边看边忘的毛病释然了，安慰自己：也许把心思花在记忆别人观点上，反而会妨碍我自己的创造力，一个人习惯于考据功夫，专心于“我注六经”，就无法做到“六经注我”了 . 这儿我也是没有很好的记性和条理。我会时不时输出一些我曾经看到过读到过的并经过我自己的理解和加工的观点，但往往会忘了出处。读了书之后，重点不在于记住谁说了什么观点，而在于把对书化成养料，拆解成最基础的东西，融入自己的体系中，和其他观点有机的结合，生长出你自己的想法。 .",

For each person you manage, maintain a running shared document of notes, takeaways, and to-dos from your 1-1s. This is helpful for you to keep context about what has happened, and is useful for remembering when and what feedback was given. It will also be an essential historical record to refer to when you’re writing reviews or delivering feedback. If you’re distracted by having a computer open in front of you during the meetings, just leave time at the end to add notes.” . 这个是一直有在做的，但成为manager之后，要记得take note，并把他们用在写feedback上 . “Trust and control are the main issues around micromanagement. If you’re micromanaging someone, chances are you’re doing it because you don’t trust that a task will be done right, or you want to very tightly control the outcome so that it meets your exact standards. This happens a lot when talented engineers become managers, especially if they pride themselves on their technical skills. If your value to the team has shifted from the thing you’re good at (writing code) to the thing you don’t yet know how to do well (managing people), it can be tempting to treat your reports as if they should be mini-mes. When a deadline slips, as it inevitably will, you view it as a failure to control the situation precisely enough, and so ratchet up the attention. You catch something not going the way you expected, and it seems to reinforce your belief that micromanaging the team is an appropriate use of your time.” . 关于micro-management，不要把自己团队看成“小我”，尤其是要抑制自己去take over的冲动，应该考虑怎么能够不通过自己直接接管更好地做法。 . “On the other hand, delegation is not the same thing as abdication. When you’re delegating responsibility, you’re still expected to be involved as much as is necessary to help the project succeed. ” . 关于delegation，不是当甩手掌柜，还是要在必要时候提供合适的帮助。 .",

Taking on a new report | Holding regular 1-1s | Giving feedback on career growth, progression toward goals, areas for improvement, and praise as warranted | Working with reports to identify areas for learning and helping them grow in these areas via project work, external learning, or additional mentoring” | . 对于管人，有4点。招新人，周期的1：1，给职业发展的反馈，包括正向的鼓励和反面的需要成长的地方，给团队不同的人不同的机会，学习的资源以及找到职业导师。 . “Your new hire needs to understand your expectations and your style just as much as you need to understand his. You’ll each need to adjust a little bit to meet the other, but if the new hire doesn’t know what you expect from him, he can’t deliver what he needs to deliver. This expectation setting on your part should include specifics like how often you want to meet with him, how the two of you will share information, and when and how often you’ll want to review his work. If you expect him to send you a weekly summary of his progress via email, tell him. Help him understand how long he should work alone trying to solve a problem, and at what point he should ask for help. For some teams this might be an hour, and for others it might be a week.” . 经理和下属之间需要有相互沟通双方的风格是怎么样的，对双方有什么期待。比如如何汇报工作，什么情况需要经理出面解决一些问题，多久见一次等等。 . “Regular 1-1s are like oil changes; if you skip them, plan to get stranded on the side of the highway at the worst possible time.” . 这个比喻还挺好玩的，如果一辆车不去做保养，那就有可能在你最不想它出现问题的时候出现问题。我见过有一些经理经常换或者取消1on1，其实是一个挺不好的习惯，如果跳过一次还好，但很多情况下是经常性的，这就证明mindset里觉得1on1不重要。 . “Respect the “maker schedule” for your reports and try to give them 1-1 times that aren’t likely to be right in the middle of their productive workflow hours.” . 这个沟通也很重要，不仅仅是1on1，其他的会也尽可能安排到一起，这样团队有整块的时间去专注地做事，而不是做1个小时，开半小时会，如此往复。这和manager mode不一样。其实即使是manager也需要有至少一周半天到1天的maker mode。 .",

As with many of the manager pitfalls, an obsession with process can be related to a fear of failure and a desire to control things to prevent the unexpected. If you are honest and make it clear that it’s safe to fail and to be imperfect, that’s often enough to get your process czar to relax a little bit and let some ambiguity in. It is very important to keep process czars from spending all of their time seeking out the perfect tool or process, and especially important to make sure that they aren’t punishing their teams for failing to follow processes.” . 这还t挺有意思的。最近组里都在建设“process”比如oncall应该怎么样处理突发问题，比如组应该怎样进行项目管理等等。首先要接受没有什么流程是完美的，也没有什么流程是会被100%遵守的，要允许有错误、遗漏。 . “You’ll be involved in most major technical decisions for your team. Involved, however, is not the same thing as being the person who makes all of them alone. If you start to make all of the technical decisions without soliciting the input of your team, they’ll resent you and blame you when things go wrong. On the other hand, if you make no technical decisions and leave everything up to the team, decisions that could have been made quickly can drag on without resolution. Determine which decisions must be made by you, which decisions should be delegated to others with more expertise, and which decisions require the whole team to resolve. In all of these cases, make it clear what the matter under discussion is, and communicate the outcome.” . 作为技术领袖（或者经理），不能所有决策都是由你来做，但也不能当甩手掌柜。决定什么样的决策需要你来做，比如说未来1年要投资的重点是什么，技术要选什么样的路线等等，让团队明白这些决定背后意味着什么，你为什么这样做决定。 . “Your productivity is now less important than the productivity of the whole team. Often, this means that you pay the price of communication overhead. Instead of having every team member sit in a meeting, you represent the team, communicate their needs, and bring information from that meeting back to the team. If one universal talent separates successful leaders from the pack, it’s communication skills. Successful leaders write well, they read carefully, and they can get up in front of a group and speak. They pay attention in meetings and are constantly testing the limits of their knowledge and the knowledge of the team. Now is a great time to practice your writing and speaking skills. Write design documents and get feedback on them from better writers. Write blog posts for your tech blog or your personal blog. Speak in team meetings, speak at meetups, and get practice standing up in front of an audience. Don’t forget to listen during all of this communication. Give others a chance to speak, and hear what they say. Practice repeating things back to people to ensure you understand them. Learn how to hear what someone says and rephrase it in your own words. If you aren’t a good note taker, you may need to become one. It doesn’t matter whether you choose to dive deep into technology, or become a manager—if you can’t communicate and listen to what other people are saying, your career growth from this point on will suffer.” . 一个领袖最重要的品质之一就是沟通， . 学会怎么输出包括口头和笔头的，口头的可以是在会议中的发言，演讲的能力，和别人1：1的能力，笔头的包括写技术设计文档，写未来发展方向文档，写技术或者个人博客等等。 | 学会怎么倾听。复述别人的观点来充分理解，好记性不如烂笔头，记录别人讲的事。 |",

Would you pore over the details of some project that is going smoothly, searching for any minor error? Or would you direct your attention to bigger problems? Would you take some of those hours to focus on the future instead of the details of the current moment? Your time is too valuable to waste, and your team deserves a manager who is willing to trust them to do things on their own.” . 如何合理的安排自己有限的工作时间，不能就把原来做engineer，tl的习惯搬过来。比如应该更关注人，关注大的技术方向（而不是小的代码提交，应该让新tl去管）。 . “Continuous feedback is, more than anything, a commitment to regularly sharing both positive and corrective feedback. Instead of saving these kinds of comments for the review cycle, managers and peers are encouraged to note when things are going well and raise issues as they happen. Some companies have started to adopt software that makes it easy for teams to provide continuous feedback and track that feedback over time, but the most important thing is that the team has adopted a culture of providing feedback frequently. For you, as a new manager, getting into the habit of continuous feedback is training you to pay attention to individuals, which in turn makes it easier to recognize and foster talent. ” . 如何培养及时的反馈文化是很重要的，要从自己做起，并且主动让团队也给你提供建议（并进行改进，让团队看到这是有效的）。 . “Observe your people. You can’t give feedback if you aren’t paying attention. If anything, I think the best outcome of attempting a continuous feedback cycle is not necessarily the actual feedback generated, but rather that the effort forces you to start paying attention to the individuals on your team. Starting this habit early in your management career, while you still may have only a few people to manage, helps you build up those observational muscles. Practice looking for talents and achievements on your team, first and foremost. Good managers have a knack for identifying talents and helping people draw more out of their strengths. Yes, you’ll also want to look for weaknesses and areas for improvement, but if you spend most of your time trying to get people to correct weaknesses, you’ll end up with a style that feels more like continuous criticism. . 锻炼自己的观察能力。多看到团队做的好的地方。 .",

Cut the work that falls below the “good enough” line, and focus the team on the most important final details. Make a launch plan; make a rollback plan. And at the end of it, don’t forget to celebrate!” . 对于项目管理来说，有一个初稿，随着进展有新的需求或者变化要及时沟通和调整，到项目快完成的时间要决定砍掉或者一定要保留某些功能。 . “You have a team. You have some control, but you’ve quickly discovered that getting people to do something is harder than just telling them to do it. You seem to have given up all control over your own day-to-day. Mostly you spend all day in meetings. You knew this was coming, but it’s not until you live it that you really understand what it means. When you only had a small team you were able to balance things and still write code, but as your team has grown you’ve lost touch with the code. It gnaws at you as something you should be doing, but there’s no time. Every time you snatch a few hours to write code, you realize that it would be irresponsible to check it in and make the team support it, so at best you snatch a script here, debug an issue there. Having the focus to build something big yourself is a distant memory.” . 这段话是写到了心坎。湾区科技公司manager的控制力其实没有想象的那么高，更多的是影响别人做事。同时自己的时间也切的比较碎，团队的事优先级往往高于你自己写一点什么代码，尤其是不能做一个大项目，因为你会成为blocker，并且如果你写的东西，让组里去维护其实成本也会很高，因为组员在项目参与时没有亲自写核心的代码。 .",

A degree of forethought, in places where you can reasonably make predictions and plans, is the goal. The plan itself, however accurate it turns out, is less important than spending time on the act of planning.” . 做计划本身是一件很有意义的事，并不是要所有进度都完全符合计划，因为现实本身就会有很多一开始考虑不到的因素出现，不断对现有的计划调整，就像不断根据交通状况，地图软件会更新最佳路径一样。和导航不同的事，一般来说导航不太会改目的地，而计划是有可能改目标的。 . “We think our management “gets” what we do as technologists. Just “read the code, man!” The software we live and breathe every day ought to seem obvious to anyone working in technology, right? But it is not. Technology managers hire the best people (hopefully), who solve very difficult problems. But they don’t “get” it all. I’ve always been surprised how grateful senior technical managers have been when I can explain some very basic modern ideas (e.g., what’s this NoSQL stuff all about, and why should I care?) to them in a nonthreatening and noncondescending way. Recently, a senior business manager at work asked me privately about why it was important for us to migrate our traditional deployed fat-client architecture to a hosted platform. He was under a lot of internal pressure to fund this effort, but he hadn’t a clue why this was necessary. He was also probably too embarrassed to ask publicly. I spent two very fruitful hours explaining (without PowerPoint!). I never hesitate nowadays to take the opportunity to explain basics and motivation to senior or junior members. It educates them without making them feel small, they learn to trust my judgment and advice, and we bring about change. Taking the time to explain is very important.” . 不要自己觉得很基础的东西就假设别人也知道。把这些基础、上下文、内在驱动力一一解释给想了解的人听，是一个非常重要的能力。尤其是要推一个比较重要的项目，越多的人理解项目的原因，需求，能达到的效果，那越容易推动这个项目。 . “Project management is the act of breaking a complex end goal down into smaller pieces, putting those pieces in roughly the most effective order they should be done, identifying which pieces can be done in parallel and which must be done in sequence, and attempting to tease out the unknowns of the project that may cause it to slow down or fail completely. You are addressing uncertainty, trying to find the unknowns, and recognizing that you are going to make mistakes in the process and miss some unknowns despite your best efforts.” . 这段话聊了项目管理是什么，也呼应了做计划的那一段。把一个不明确的项目拆解成可执行的任务，并判断任务之间的相互依赖，发现一些可能存在的威胁。并在整个项目执行的过程中承认一开始计划的局限性，并及时调整。 .",

Some days you’re on a maker’s schedule, and some days you’re on a manager’s schedule. Through trial and error, you’ll need to learn how to manage your time to provide yourself with appropriately sized blocks to work in. The worst scheduling mistake is allowing yourself to get pulled randomly into meetings. It is very difficult to get into the groove of writing code if you’re interrupted every hour by a meeting.” . “You also know that it’s important to get your team into a schedule that allows them to be focused on development for long stretches of time, because they will need to focus for several days on coding problems. Part of your leadership is helping the other stakeholders, such as your boss and the product manager, respect the team’s focus and set up meeting calendars that are not overwhelming for individual contributors.” . 不能同意更多，最近的状态就是又要写代码测试，又要管理团队和项目。会有manager’s schedule和maker’s schedule的冲突，一开始我觉得每天把两者交叉起来可行，比如早上10-11：30下午2-3点写代码，其他时间开会，看项目等等，现在发现在一天之内的交叉对于我的撕裂感太强，尤其是写代码往往1-2小时根本不能静下心来写，每隔一天还得再想之前写到哪儿了。现在我尽量会把写代码安排到一整个下午，不受打扰地写。但长久来看，慢慢成为manager后，应该不能成为一个项目的主要输出，因为这样会导致没有时间兼顾大局。 . “This role requires you to have a good sense of the overall architecture of your systems and a solid understanding of how to design complex software. It probably also requires you to be able to understand business requirements and translate them into software.” . TL的责任是对整体系统的理解和设计，以及如何把商业需求转化成具体的产品和服务，然后带领团队去完成。 . “Why is the tech lead role such a heavy burden? The tech lead has a much wider scope of responsibility than the senior engineer in an individual contributor position. The tech lead is called on to help architect a project, and then to go through the steps of actually planning out the work. The tech lead is expected to make sure the team fully understands the project requirements, the work is planned, and the team is effective and performing well, all without necessarily having any management responsibilities and usually without any specific training. And, realistically, most managers will expect their tech leads to continue to write almost as much code as they did before they took on the lead role. It’s generally a pure increase in responsibility and scope of work. If you’re a first-time tech lead, you have your hands very full.” . 对于TL来说，在创业公司的话，确实会可能需要写不少代码，看到过很多TL白天开会，帮组员，晚上自己输出。个人觉得自己是无法做到这种强度的工作的，而且当组变得更大（&gt;10人）后，可能个人的输出就变得不是那么重要，除非是别人都写不出来的东西。 .",

These standards include: Regular (weekly) 1-1 touchbases Regular feedback on career growth, progression towards goals, areas for improvement, and praise as warranted Working with reports to identify areas for learning and helping them grow in these areas via project work, external learning, or additional mentoring If a tech lead is not managing directly, they are still expected to provide mentorship and guidance to the other members of the team. The tech lead is learning how to be a strong technical project manager, and as such, they are scaling themselves by delegating work effectively without micromanaging. They focus on the whole team’s productivity and strive to increase the impact of the team’s work product. They are empowered to make independent decisions for the team and are learning how to handle difficult management and leadership situations. They are also learning how to partner effectively with product, analytics, and other areas of the business. It is not required that an engineer work as a tech lead to progress, but it is the most common way for engineers to grow from senior engineer 1 -&gt; 2 and is required to grow from senior engineer 2 to engineering lead. Realistically it is very hard to grow past senior engineer 2 without ever having acted as a tech lead, even on the individual contributor track, due to the importance at senior levels of leadership and responsibility.” . 这儿的定义其实更加偏向于Tech Lead Manager，不仅需要做管理的工作，很大一部分重心还会在技术上。如何带好内部的团队，以及和外部相关团队打交道，并做好计划等等。国内互联网对一线经理基本上就是这种要求，在湾区这边的科技公司，一般把管理岗和技术岗区分的相对比较开，Engineering Manager (不同于TLM)考核标准主要还是看团队开不开心，平级的相关团队对团队的评价，团队的总产出等等。TLM基本上还是比较少见的，是一种平衡技术和管理的岗位，对大的团队（大于10人）基本上很难平衡，因为管理的相关事宜就很多了。 . “Perhaps a better shorthand for this is the description used by Patrick Kua in his book, Talking with Tech Leads: A leader, responsible for a (software) development team, who spends at least 30 percent of their time writing code with the team. Tech leads are in the position to act as strong technical project leaders, and to use their expertise at a larger scale so that their whole team gets better. They can make independent decisions, and they play a big role in coordinating with other nonengineering partners that their team might have. You’ll note that there’s nothing here about specifically technical work. This is a senior engineering role, but it’s a mistake to tie the notion of tech lead to one that boils down to the best or most experienced engineer on the team. You can’t lead without engaging other people, and people skills are what we’re asking the new tech lead to stretch, much more than pure technical expertise. However, tech leads will be working on one major new technical skill: project management. The work of breaking down a project has a lot of similarity to the work of designing systems, and learning this skill is valuable[…]” . 这里提到了TL除了技术外还需要有好的沟通协调能力，拆解项目并管理项目的能力。 .",

Emotional labor is a way to think about traditionally feminine “soft skills”—that is, skills that address the emotional needs of people and teams. Because the outcome can be hard to quantitatively measure, emotional labor is often dismissed as less important work than writing software. It’s assumed to be something that should just be provided without financial recognition. I’m not suggesting that you should pay people extra money to serve as mentors, but they need to be recognized for the work they put in, and the mentor should be treated as a first-class citizen with respect to other responsibilities the person might have. As I said before, plan for it, and provide the mentor the time to do the job right. You have already invested in creating this mentoring relationship, whether it’s the thousands of dollars and many hours spent on hiring, or the overhead and coordination of creating a mentoring program. It’s worth continuing the investment through to[…]” . 在Meta，mentorship是算作比较重要的people方面的贡献的。还有的比如带intern，做面试等等 . “Mentoring provides a great opportunity to cultivate curiosity and see the world through fresh eyes. When faced with a mentee’s questions, you can start to observe what about your organization is not so obvious to a new person. You might find areas you thought you understood but cannot explain clearly. And you’ll have the opportunity to review the assumptions you’ve collected in your time working that may be worth questioning. While many people think creativity is about seeing new things, it’s also about seeing patterns that are hidden to others. It’s hard to see patterns when the only data points you have are your own experiences. Working with new people who are learning things for the first time can shed light on these hidden patterns and help you make connections you may not otherwise have made.” . mentorship对于自己的帮助是从新人的角度重新发现系统、组的问题。因为老人已经都习惯了一些设置，即使不那么合理或是人性化。 . “The idea that the tech lead role should automatically be given to the most experienced engineer, the one who can handle the most complex features or who writes the best code, is a common misconception that even experienced managers fall for. Tech lead is not the job for the person who wants the freedom to focus deeply on the details of her own code.” . 关于技术带头人（Tech Lead），一种迷思是TL就是技术最牛逼的。我的个人感受是作为TL，我可以对某个部分没有组里的一些人清楚，但我需要对整个系统有自己的概念，它什么地方是关键的，什么地方可以被优化，未来的发展方向是什么，这些需要有清楚的概念，同时也要对组里的人在做什么项目有清晰的了解，帮助每个人尽可能去做有意义、高优先级的事，了解每个人的技术优缺点，把合适的人放在合适的项目中。 .",

At more senior levels of work, opportunities for promotion are much more rare, and your manager may need you to find and propose the achievements that qualify you for the next level.” . 这基本上是对的，针对IC3 to IC6（大致对应阿里的P6-P9)经理基本都知道应该怎么去做升职。但要从IC6到7，更多地是你自己要去发现机会，告诉你经理，让他能够帮到你。 . “You’ll probably go through periods of career uncertainty in your life. Many people feel very uncertain in their first two to five years out of school, as they settle into independent adulthood. I felt so unsettled that I went to grad school for a couple of years, in what turned out to be a quest to find security in the familiar academic setting and an escape from a job I didn’t know how to navigate well. I hit uncertainty again after climbing the technical ladder only to feel somewhat powerless at a big company. And then I hit it again after climbing the management ladder only to encounter the challenges of executive leadership. I expect I’ll experience it every 5 to 10 years until I retire, given my track record. As you go through various stages of your career, you’ll start to realize how much uncertainty there is in the world. It’s a pretty universal truth that once you get the job you thought you wanted, the enjoyment eventually fades and you find yourself looking for something else. You think you want to work for that cool startup, and you get there only to find it’s a mess. You think you want to be a manager, only to discover that the job is hard and not rewarding in the ways you expected.” . 基本上5-10年会是一个坎，职业上会有比较大的变化。比如我现在就是要从一个纯粹的tech track转到management track。但这也是一种自主的选择，如果选择停下脚步，那可能能过的比较舒服，但得到的成长也就变少。 . “Be prepared to say anything complex a few times, in different ways. If you feel that you don’t understand something your mentee has asked you, repeat the question in a different way. Let him correct you.” . 对新进组的人来说，这个很重要，老人总觉得某些事已经说的很明白了，但新人可能对上下文还不熟，所以只是一知半解，或者觉得听懂了，但和老人说的不是一个意思。这个时候要慢下来，用不同的方式多重复几次。 .",

            "content": "在弄明白这一点之前，你会一直有个困扰：“到底是应该严格遵守戒律的繁文缛节，抑或是可以不拘泥于形式?”只要你完全明白了我们的禅道，就不会再有这种困扰，因为你做的任何事无非都是修行。 只要秉持一颗大乘的心，那么修行就没有大乘与小乘的分别。哪怕你的行为看似犯了戒，但你却是在真切的意义上持守着戒律，重点是，你怀抱的是一颗大心还是一颗小心。 简单来说，只要做任何事情时都不思善、不思恶，都是倾注你全副身心去做，那么你就符合我们的禅道了。道元禅师说过： 如果你对某人说什么而他不赞同，不要尝试从知性上说服他。不要跟他争辩，只要听他的反对意见，让他自己发现自己错在哪里。 . 生与死是同一件事 出生以前我们是没有感觉的，我们与宇宙一体。这种一体性称为“唯心”、“真如”、“大心”。出生让我们脱离这种一体性（就像那些从瀑布泻下而被风或岩石分隔开的水），让我们有了七情六欲。你会有烦恼是因为你有七情六欲，你执著于七情六欲而不知道它们是怎样产生的。当水滴落入河里，回到它与河流本有的“一如”，就不会再有任何个体的感觉。它归复到本性，找到了从容自若。回到河里去的水滴是何等快乐！ 如果是这样，我们死的时候会是什么感觉呢？我想，我们的感觉就会像河里的水那般从容自若，无比地从容自若。但是目前，这种境界对我们来说似乎遥不可及，因为我们仍然非常执著于自己的感觉，执著于自己的个体性的存在。 此刻，我们对死亡仍然感到恐惧，但等到归复到真实本性，死亡将与涅槃无异，我们之所以常说“涅槃即断灭”，道理在此。但“断灭”并不是非常精确的说法，更好的形容应该是“继续”和“加入”。 . 去除了我，就出现了佛 根据传统佛教的理解，我们的本性是没有自我的。当我们去除了“我”的观念，就能够以佛的眼光来看待人生。“我”的观念只是迷执，会蒙蔽我们的佛性。但我们总是不断去制造这个“我”，把这种过程重复又重复，结果是，我们的人生完全被各种自我中心的观念所充塞，这样的人生称为“业命”。 . 在佛陀获得开悟之前，他为我们试过了五花八门的修行方式，最后终于对各种方式都有了透彻理解。各位也许会以为，当佛陀达到开悟的境界，他就摆脱了业命的羁绊，从此与我们一般人就全然不同了，但事实并非如此。当他的国家与强邻开战时，他告诉弟子，看着自己的国家就要被别国征服，他的内心无比痛苦。如果一个人开悟后可以摆脱业力的话，照理说佛陀应该不会为任何事情而痛苦，然而，他却还是会感到痛苦。此外，即使开悟之后，佛陀仍继续与我们一样努力修行，但是开悟却让他对生命的观点变得无可撼动，且稳若磐石。他观察一切的生命，包括他自己的生命。他以同样的眼光对待自己、对待他人、对待石头、对待树木和其他一切。他拥有了非常科学的理解，这就是他获得开悟后的生活方式。 . 因为你的心被某些别的观念或别人的观念给纠缠住了，你不是独立的，你不是你自己，也因此那不是自然。哪怕你盘腿而坐，但只要你的坐禅不是自然的，就不是真正在修行。口渴时，你不用强迫自己，你自然就会去喝水了，因为这时候喝水对你来说是愉快的。 如果你在坐禅时感到喜乐，那才是真正的坐禅。不过即使你得勉强自己才会坐禅，但只要你在其中感到受益，那也是坐禅。事实上，你是不是勉强自己并不重要，即使修行中碰到困难，但只要你想要坐禅，那就是自然。 .",

            "content": "尽管你想尽办法要把某些人置于你的管制之下，但那是不可能的。管理别人最好的方法是鼓励他们使坏，然后，广义地来说，他们就会受到你的管制。给你的牛或羊—片宽敞的绿草地是管好它们的方法，对人也是一样的道理。首先，让他们做他们想做的事，你从旁看守他们，这是“上策”。要是对他们置之不理，那是不对的，是“下下策”。“次下策”就是试图去驾驭他们。“上上策”是看着他们，但只是看着，不存有任何想控制他们的心。 任杂念自由来去 同样的道理也可以用在你自己身上。在坐禅时，如果你想获得完全的平静，就不应该被心中出现的各种杂念困扰，应该任它们来、任它们去，然后这些杂念反而会被你所控制。但这个方法并不容易——听起来是很容易，但事实上需要费点特别的努力。 怎么样才能达成这种努力呢？这正是禅修的秘密所在。比方说你碰到某些烦心事，要完全静下心来打坐是不可能的，如果你拼命压制心念，你的努力就是不正确的努力。唯一可帮助你的努力就是数息，或是把心念专注在一呼一吸上。我说“专注”，但把心念专注在某件事情上并不是禅的真正本意。禅的本意是如物之所如去观物的本身，让一切自来自去。这是最广义的把一切置于控制之下。 禅修的目的在于打开我们的“小心”，所以专注是为了帮助你体现“大心”，也就是包含万有的心。如果想在日常生活中发现禅的真义，你就必须要先明白，坐禅时，身体为什么要保持适当的坐姿，以及心念为什么要专注在呼吸上。你应该遵循修行的法则，这样你的修行将会愈来愈精细和谨慎。只有这个方法可以引领你，体验到禅的无上自由。 . 当我们体验到这种真理时，就表示我们已经悟出了时间的真义。时间都是恒常地从过去前进到现在，再从现在前进到未来。这是真的，但时间会从未来来到现在，或是从现在走向过去，这也同样是真的。有一位禅师说过：“向东走一里就是向西走一里。”这是真正的自由，我们每个人都应该追寻这种完全的自由。 但没有一些规则规范，就不可能有完全的自由。很多人（尤其是年轻人）以为，所谓的“自由”就是只要我喜欢的事就可以做，禅根本无须讲什么规则。但事实上，对禅修者而言，遵行某些规则是绝对必要的。只要有规则可循，你就拥有获得自由的机会。对规则不屑一顾的人，可别想要有任何自由可言。我们之所以禅修，正是为了获得完全的自由。 . 修行时想要让心平静下来，并不需要花太多时间。很多感觉会生起，很多杂念或思绪会涌现，但它们只是你自己的心的涟漪，没有任何东西会来自心的外部。我们一般都以为，心是一个接收自外而来的印象或经验的器物，但这不是对心的正确理解。正确的理解应该是：“心包含了―切。”当你以为有什么从外头进来了，那只是意味着你的心上浮现什么。没有任何在你之外的东西可以引起困扰。你心上的涟漪是你自己制造出来的，如果你让你的心如如呈现它自身的样子，它就会变得平静。这样的心称为“大心”。 如果你的心与某种外在的事物产生连接，它就会沦为一颗“小心”，一颗有限的心。如果心不与任何其他事物有所连接，心的活动就不会有二元性，你会把为心的活动理解为只是心的涟漪罢了。大心会体验到，一切都尽在自己一心之中。 你明白以下两种心的差别吗？一种是包含一切的心，一种是与外物连接的心。两种心事实上只是同样的东西，但因为你的了解不同而有了差别，连带使你对生命的态度也因此一了解的不同而产生差异。 .",

Introduce the framework to them right away, and schedule a first conversation with each of them to talk about the situation and about your expectations.” “Helping direct reports accelerate their transitions is about more than being a good manager and contributing to others’ development. The faster your direct reports get up to speed, the better able they will be to help you reach your goals.” . 不仅要和老板有STARS conversation，和团推成员也要有类似的交流，来相互校准整个团队整体的STARS portfolio。 . “Plan Your Waves In planning for your transition (and beyond), focus on making successive waves of change. Each wave should consist of distinct phases: learning, designing the changes, building support, implementing the changes, and observing results.” . “If you keep changing things, it is impossible to figure out what is working and what is not. Unending change is also a surefire recipe for burning out your people. The goal of the first wave of change is to secure early wins. The new leader tailors early initiatives to build personal credibility, establish key relationships, and identify and harvest low-hanging fruit—the highest-potential opportunities for short-term improvements in organizational performance. Done well, this strategy helps the new leader build momentum and deepen his own learning. The second wave of change typically addresses more fundamental issues of strategy, structure, systems, and skills to reshape the organization; deeper gains in organizational performance are achieved. But you will not get there if you don’t secure early wins in the first wave.” . 不要想着一步到位，即使你知道问题的根源在很深处，也要一步步解决，第一波要找准early wins，能够拿出成绩，建立momentum，第一步再是解决更加深入和根本的问题。一口吃不成胖子。 .",

If you want to succeed, you need your boss’s help; in turn, you should help her succeed. When you pay attention to your boss’s priorities, she will feel ownership in your success. The most effective approach is to integrate your boss’s goals with your own efforts to get early wins. If this is impossible, look for early wins based solely on your boss’s priorities.” . 其实老美也是懂得老板的优先级就是最重要的，你的成功和老板的成功很大程度上是重叠的。 . “Whether you and your boss agree on expectations, try to bias yourself somewhat toward underpromising achievements and overdelivering results. This strategy contributes to building credibility. Consider how your organization’s capacity for change might affect your ability to deliver on the promises you make. Be conservative in what you promise. If you deliver more, you will delight your boss. But if you promise too much and fail to deliver, you risk undermining your credibility. Even if you accomplish a great deal, you will have failed in the boss’s eyes.” . 少承诺一些，但说到做到，并超出承诺。这个并不是说你本来能完成100，你就承诺50，而是承诺差不多70，完成90-100 . “Your boss will have a comfort zone about her involvement in decision making. Think of this zone as defining the boundaries of the decision-making box in which you will operate. What sorts of decisions does she want you to make on your own but tell her about? Initially, expect to be confined to a relatively small box. As your new boss gains confidence in you, the dimensions of the box should increase.” . 信任的获取都是循序渐进的，这也是在之前五个对话里提到的，关于风格和期待，当你完成了更多时，老板对你的信任和期待也就更高，对你的风格可能就是”你告诉我什么最重要“ .",

Your new boss’s opinion of you will be based in part on direct interactions and in part on what she hears about you from trusted others. Your boss will have preexisting relationships with people who are now your peers and possibly your subordinates. You needn’t curry favor with the people your boss trusts. Simply be alert to the multiple channels through which information and opinion about you will reach your boss.” . 目前要转TLM就经历了类似的情况，老板会从我的peer以及相关的senior engineer来看他们对我转成经理有没有顾虑。 . “The situational diagnosis conversation. In this conversation, you seek to understand how your new boss sees the STARS portfolio you have inherited. Are there elements of start-up, turnaround, accelerated growth, realignment, and sustaining success? How did the organization reach this point? What factors—both soft and hard—make this situation a challenge? What resources within the organization can you draw on? Your view may differ from your boss’s, but it is essential to grasp how she sees the situation.” . “The expectations conversation. Your goal in this conversation is to understand and negotiate expectations. What does your new boss need you to do in the short term and in the medium term? What will constitute success? Critically, how will your performance be measured? When? You might conclude that your boss’s expectations are unrealistic and that you need to work to reset them. Also, as part of your broader campaign to secure early wins, discussed in the next chapter, keep in mind that it’s better to underpromise and overdeliver.” . “The resource conversation. This conversation is essentially a negotiation for critical resources. What do you need to be successful? What do you need your boss to do? The resources need not be limited to funding or personnel. In a realignment, for example, you may need help from your boss to persuade the organization to confront the need for change. Key here is to focus your boss on the benefits and costs of what you can accomplish with different amounts of resources.” . “The style conversation. This conversation is about how you and your new boss can best interact on an ongoing basis. What forms of communication does he prefer, and for what? Face-to-face? Voice, electronic? How often? What kinds of decisions does he want to be consulted on, and when can you make the call on your own? How do your styles differ, and what are the implications for the ways you should interact?” . “The personal development conversation. Once you’re a few months into your new role, you can begin to discuss how you’re doing and what your developmental priorities should be. Where are you doing well? In what areas do you need to improve or do things differently? Are there projects or special assignments you could undertake (without sacrificing focus)?” . 五个重要的对话：理解现状，校准期待，探讨资源，适配风格，着眼发展。对于从组织内部成长起来的人，其实也要有这些对话，因为本身就比较熟悉，但还是需要和老板有正式地讨论，让大家的想法同步。 .",

Many new leaders just play the game, reactively taking their situation as given—and failing as a result. The alternative is to shape the game by negotiating with your boss to establish realistic expectations, reach consensus, and secure sufficient resources.” . 和老板讨论成功的定义，合理的期待，你能拿到的资源。 . “Don’t surprise your boss. It’s no fun bringing your boss bad news. However, most bosses consider it a far greater sin not to report emerging problems early enough. Worst of all is for your boss to learn about a problem from someone else. It’s usually best to give your new boss at least a heads-up as soon as you become aware of a developing problem.” . 这个确实是很重要的点，隐瞒比坏消息更坏，因为往往为时太晚不能不久了 . “This is a good thing to keep in mind in dealing with direct reports, too. It can be dangerous to say, “Don’t bring me problems, bring me solutions.” Far better is, “Don’t just bring me problems, bring me plans for how we can begin to address them.” . 这也是j经常聊的一点，提出问题很关键，但不是全部。我也觉得一开始不需要一个完整的计划，而是提出一些可能性可以开始讨论并衡量那种可能性最适合解决问题。 . “Don’t run down your checklist. There is a tendency, even for senior leaders, to use meetings with a boss as an opportunity to run through your checklist of what you’ve been doing. Sometimes this is appropriate, but it is rarely what your boss needs or wants to hear. You should assume she wants to focus on the most important things you’re trying to do and how she can help. Don’t go in without at most three things you really need to share or on which you need action.” . 我和老板聊天的时候从来不会说我最近做了ABCD, 而是我们觉得最重要的几件事会深入讨论。 .",

The most challenging situation was assessed to be realignment, followed by sustaining success and turnaround. Start-up and accelerated growth were assessed as being significantly easier. However, when it came to preferences, the pattern reversed, with start-up being (by far) the most popular, followed by turnaround and accelerated growth. This is not a surprising finding, and the underlying reasons are revealing. It is not the case that people are drawn to the easy situations. Rather, they are drawn to situations that are (1) more fun and (2) get more recognition. A successful start-up is a visible and easily measurable individual accomplishment, as is a successful turnaround. In a realignment, in contrast, success consists of avoiding disaster. It is hard to measure results in a realignment when success means that nothing much happens; it’s the dog that doesn’t bark. Also, success in realignment requires painstakingly building awareness of the need for change, and that often means giving credit to the group rather than taking it yourself. As for rewarding sustaining success, people seldom call their local power company to say, “Thanks for keeping the lights on today.” But if[…]” . . start-ups和turnarounds最容易看出成果。accelerated-growth次之，最不想做realignment以及sustaining-success因为他们基本没有外部的动力，相当于没有天时地利人和，需要创造需求或者是不断影响让大家居安思危。 .",

Performance in a realignment may be better than expected, but still poor. Or it may be that nothing much seems to happen, because a crisis was avoided. Sustaining-success situations pose similar problems. Success may consist of a small loss of market share in the face of a concerted attack by competitors or the eking out of a few percentage points of top-line growth in a mature business. The unknown in both realignments and sustaining-success situations is what would have happened if other actions had been taken or other people had been in charge—the “as compared to what?” problem. Measuring success in such situations takes much more work, because to assess the adequacy of their responses, you must have a deep understanding of the challenges new leaders face and the actions they are taking. ” . STARS模型是指组织、公司所处的状态：start-up，turn-around, accelarated growth, realignment, sustain-success. 在重定位和维持成功这两种状态是比较难评价一个领导者的成功和失败的。因为这两种状态下，企业相对都是在比较好的状态里的，如果是维持现状感觉就是领导者也没做什么，大家会觉得这是理所当然的，而想要提高或者让大家意识到危机又不是件容易的事。 . “A key implication is that success in transitioning depends, in no small measure, on your ability to transform the prevailing organizational psychology in predictable ways. In start-ups, the prevailing mood is often one of excited confusion, and your job is to channel that energy into productive directions, in part by deciding what not to do. In turnarounds, you may be dealing with a group of people who are close to despair; it is your job to provide them with a concrete plan for moving forward and confidence that it will improve the situation. In accelerated-growth situations, you need to help people understand that the organization needs to be more disciplined and get them to work within defined processes and systems. In realignments, you will likely have to pierce the veil of denial that is preventing people from confronting the need to reinvent the business. Finally, in sustaining-success situations, you must invent the challenge by finding ways to keep people motivated, combat complacency, and find new direction for growth—both organizational and personal.” . 这里很好地描述了，当你在到了不同STARS的情况中，让大家能意识到什么是最重要的是一个transition成功与否的标准。对于start-ups，大家容易对很多新的点很兴奋，你要做的是更好地把这种情绪导向更有价值的方向，并对一些事说不。在turnaround中，大家都是很绝望、焦虑的，提供一个很具体的执行计划让大家一起努力重拾信心。在accelerated-growth中，不能再像startups一样野蛮生长，需要建立一些流程和制度，让大家做事更有条理。在realignment中，让大家意思到自己拒绝承认问题所在，并且直面这些问题来迎接新的挑战。在sustaining-success里，需要去创造新的挑战来激励大家。 .",

Armed with insight into the organization’s history, you may indeed decide that things need to change. Or you may find there is a good reason to leave it exactly where it is. A related learning block, as mentioned in the introduction, is the action imperative. The primary symptom is a nearly compulsive need to take action. Effective leaders strike the right balance between doing (making things happen) and being (observing and reflecting). But it is challenging, as Chris Hadley found, to let yourself “be” during transitions. And the pressure to “do” almost always comes more from inside the leader than from outside forces; it reflects a lack of confidence and a consequent need to prove yourself. Remember: simply displaying a genuine desire to learn and understand translates into increased credibility and influence.” . 在transition中都会有欲望去做一些改变来证明自己，但我们需要平衡“学习和反思历史”与“真正去改变和做事”之间的关联。最近组里有一个technical program manager在onboard，发现她就是属于很好地去学习组里的wiki和每个人沟通，并且看短期内有什么事是她可以有贡献的。 . “In the cultural domain, you must learn about norms, values, and behavioral expectations, which are almost certainly different from those in the organization you came from, even if you’re moving between units in the same company. In the political domain, you must understand the shadow organization—the informal set of processes and alliances that exist in the shadow of the formal structure and strongly influence how work actually gets done. The political domain is both important and difficult to understand, because it isn’t easily visible to those who have not spent time in the organization and because political land mines can easily stymie your efforts to establish a solid base of support during the transition.” . 在transition过程中，如何学习大家的行为准则，比较重视什么方面，以及桌面下的组织结构，谁说话在什么方面有分量，得到谁的支持做某些方面的事最重要等等。 . “When you are diagnosing a new organization, start by meeting with your direct reports one-on-one. (This is an example of taking a horizontal slice across an organization by interviewing people at the same level in different functions.) Ask them essentially the same five questions: . What are the biggest challenges the organization is facing (or will face in the near future)? | Why is the organization facing (or going to face) these challenges? | What are the most promising unexploited opportunities for growth? | What would need to happen for the organization to exploit the potential of these opportunities? | If you were me, what would you focus attention on? ” “These five questions, coupled with careful listening and thoughtful follow-up, are certain to elicit many insights; think of what Chris might have learned by using this approach. By asking everyone the same set of questions, you can identify prevalent and divergent views and thus avoid being swayed by the first or most forceful or articulate person you talk to. How people answer can also tell you a lot about your new team and its politics. Who answers directly, and who is evasive or prone to tangents? Who takes responsibility, and who points fingers? Who has a broad view of the business, and who seems stuck in a silo?” “the point is that even a modest structure—a script and a sequence of interactions, such as meeting with people individually, doing some analysis, and then meeting with them together—can dramatically accelerate your ability to extract actionable insights” | . 单独和组员问同样的一组问题，去了解每个人的特点，以及组员之间的关系。然后把总结的内容通过组会再分享给整个组，并从中找出一些闪光点以及可以改善的点。 .",

Early in your career, there is a premium on cultivating good technical advisers—experts in certain aspects of marketing or finance, for instance, who can help you get your work done. As you move to higher levels, however, it becomes increasingly important to get good political counsel and personal advice. Political counselors help you understand the politics of the organization, an understanding that is especially important when you plan to implement change. Personal advisers help you keep perspective and equilibrium in times of stress. Transforming your advice-and-counsel network is never easy; your current advisers may be close friends, and you may feel comfortable with technical advisers whose domains you know well. But it is essential to step back and recognize where you need to build your networks to compensate for blind spots and gaps in your own expertise or experience.” . 这点还是挺重要的。比如我现在要从individual contributor到manager的transition，需要找一些mentor，来学习一些新的知识。 . “If you have been promoted to supervise people who were once your peers, some may be disappointed competitors. Some may even work to undermine you. This kind of thing may subside with time. But expect early tests of your authority, and plan to meet them by being firm and fair. If you don’t establish limits early, you will live to regret it. Getting others to accept your move is an essential part of preparing yourself. So if you conclude that the people in question are never going to accept your new role and the resulting situation, then you must find a way to move them out of your organization as quickly as possible.” . 对于同事，如果你成为manager，那expectation就需要有调整。有些本来可以说的话，在成为上下级关系后就不能随便说了。 .

            "content": "“They attribute the high failure rate of outside hires to several barriers, notably the following: . Leaders from outside the company are not familiar with informal networks of information and communication. | Outside hires are not familiar with the corporate culture and therefore have greater difficulty navigating. | New people are unknown to the organization and therefore do not have the same credibility as someone who is promoted from within. | A long tradition of hiring from within makes it difficult for some organizations to accept outsiders. To overcome these barriers and succeed in joining a new company, you should focus on four pillars of effective onboarding: business orientation, stakeholder connection, alignment of expectations, and cultural adaptation.” | 空降的管理者往往面对的是文化上的不适应，对于团队内部权利结构不熟悉，没有什么盟友，以及团队本身可能带有的排外性。 . “Getting oriented to the business means learning about the company as a whole and not only your specific parts of the business. As you work to understand the organization, it’s worth thinking beyond simply the financials, products, and strategy. Regardless of your position, for example, it’s beneficial to learn about the brands and products you will be supporting, whether or not you’re directly involved in sales and marketing. Focus, too, on understanding the operating model, planning and performance evaluation systems, and talent management systems, because they often powerfully influence how you can most effectively have an impact.” . 对于Business oerientation来说，其实这个词本身比较难理解，但这儿解释的挺好的。就是要对整个公司不同方面有所理解，而不是仅仅关注于自己的团队。 . “Having to start learning again can evoke long-buried and unnerving feelings of incompetence or vulnerability, especially if you suffer early setbacks. You may find yourself mentally revisiting a juncture in your career when you had less confidence. Perhaps you will make some early missteps and experience failure for the first time in ages. So you unconsciously begin to gravitate toward areas where you feel competent and toward people who reinforce your feelings of self-worth.” . 来到新团队，或是面对新的职位，很多事情要重头学习，会让人降低自信，甚至会犯一些过来人觉得很简单的错误。我觉得这种时候给自己的expectation就是要和老板align目标，快速 学习，小成本试错，知道什么是可行的。 .",

First, the issues you’re dealing with become much more complex and ambiguous when you move up a level—and your ability to identify “right” answers based solely on data and analysis declines correspondingly. Decisions are shaped more by others’ expert judgments and who trusts whom, as well as by networks of mutual support. Second, at a higher level of the organization, the other players are more capable and have stronger egos. Remember, you were promoted because you are able and driven; the same is true for everyone around you. So it shouldn’t come as a surprise that the decision-making game becomes much more bruising and politically charged the higher up you go. It’s critical, then, for you to become more effective at building and sustaining alliances.” . 越到高层，决策就不仅仅是看数据说话了，有不同的利益相关方，不同的专业人士，所以不是说老板一个人说的算，也是要有一个听取各方面意见，了解权力结构、利益结构，平衡多方需求的决策。目前在做的事已经有一点偏向这个层面的了，为了推动一个跨部门的项目，怎么让大家互相合作，推动各自相关项目的进展是一个很难的事，也不能想着毕其功于一役，需要拆解目标，分析小目标之间的关系，完成小的目标来推动更大目标的达成。 . “You also need to establish new channels for communicating your strategic intent and vision across the organization—convening town-hall–type meetings rather than individual or small-group sessions, or using electronic communication to broadcast your messages to the widest possible audiences.” . 职位越高就越和一线的团队脱节，所以好多VP, Director等级都会有regular QA, 每个季度参加一下一线的组会，等等的沟通渠道，了解真实的一线团队的需求，问题，士气等等方面 .",

She failed to grasp that the strengths that had made her successful in marketing could be liabilities in a role that required her to lead without direct authority or superior expertise. She kept doing what she knew how to do, making her feel confident and in control. The result, of course, was the opposite. By not letting go of the past and not fully embracing her new role, she squandered a big opportunity to rise in the organization.” . 过去的成功经验并不一定在环境发生变化时，再次带来成功。但人们往往又过于依赖那些成功的经验。我觉得学会和逆向学会都是很重要的事，要永远保持一个开放的头脑，去分析新的情况，而不是直接套用过去的经验。 . “You also need to learn to strike the right balance between keeping the wide view and drilling down into the details. This juggling act can be challenging, because what had been the fifty-thousand-foot view in your previous role may be equivalent to the world at five thousand feet, or even five hundred feet, in your new job.” . 平衡大局和细节也是很重要的一点。我目前感觉很难同时在两个方面同时做到100分，最终人的时间和精力都是有限的，要思考的是最重要的一件事是什么，如果对于当下来说是把控好细节，那就要明确和相关人员说对于大局的把控质量会下降，同时要不断的去问自己下一个当下最重要的是什么（和长远最重要的目标相比较和平衡）。老板的战术=你的战略，当你成为你老板的等级你原来的战略可能就只是战术了。 . “The complexity and ambiguity of the issues you are dealing with increase every time you get promoted. So you’ll need to rethink what you delegate. No matter where you land, the keys to effective delegation remain much the same: you build a team of competent people whom you trust, you establish goals and metrics to monitor their progress, you translate higher-level goals into specific responsibilities for your direct reports, and you reinforce them through process. When you get promoted, however, what you delegate usually needs to change. If you’re leading an organization of five people, it may make sense to delegate specific tasks such as drafting a piece of marketing material or selling to a particular customer. In an organization of fifty people, your focus may shift from tasks to projects and processes. At five hundred people, you often need to delegate responsibility for specific products or platforms. And at five thousand people, your direct reports may be responsible for entire businesses.” . 这里也强调了每一次升职，你需要思考的层面和复杂度就会发生变化。一个VP不可能天天想着某个代码怎么写，一个一线的manager也不可能天天想着怎么让工程部门的文化变得更好。同时在什么层面，需要你的直接下属做的事也不同，不能自己还停留在上个层面，抢了其实可以让团队得到锻炼的活，而忽略了你老板希望你开始做的新的活。 .",

You spend too much time focused on vertical relationships—up to the boss and down to direct reports—and not enough on peers and other stakeholders. You don’t fully understand what it will take to succeed, and you miss early opportunities to build supportive alliances.” . 这里说的两个transition trap我觉得是比较容易被人忽略的。就比如做engineering manager，有些manager之前是比较强的工程师，所以到一个新的组会很偏重理解系统，而没有太关心文化、人与人的关系，信息的渠道。其次，有很多人只关心上下级，而没有注重平级的关系建设，这些人是能够在你make a big bet的时候站出来支持你的人。 . “Match your strategy to the situation. Different types of situations require you to make significant adjustments in how you plan for and execute your transition. Start-ups, for instance—of a new product, process, plant, or business—present challenges quite different from those you would face while turning around a product, process, or plant in serious trouble. A clear diagnosis of the situation is an essential prerequisite for developing your action plan.” . 根据不同的情境，要采用不同的计划和策略。有些公司需要你能从无到有建立产品，有些公司需要你大量扩张并建立流程和系统去更好地管理大量招进来的人，有些公司需要你来逆转业务面对的困境，有些公司需要你在现有成功业务的基础上开发新的业务持续增长等等。 . “Secure early wins. Early wins build your credibility and create momentum. They create virtuous cycles that leverage the energy you put into the organization to create a pervasive sense that good things are happening. ” . 在前几个月要赚到一些early wins，不一定是很大的成功，因为那种需要更长时间的积累，更现实的情况是一些low hanging fruits或者一些minimum viable product之类的项目，去快速建立一些个人品牌，进入一个正向的反馈。 .",

            "content": "“Why are transitions critical? When I surveyed more than thirteen hundred senior HR leaders, almost 90 percent agreed that “transitions into new roles are the most challenging times in the professional lives of leaders.”1 And nearly three-quarters agreed that “success or failure during the first few months is a strong predictor of overall success or failure in the job.” So even though a bad transition does not necessarily doom you to failure, it makes success a lot less likely. The good news on transitions is that they give you a chance to start afresh and make needed changes in an organization. But transitions are also periods of acute vulnerability, because you lack established working relationships and a detailed understanding of your new role. You’re managing under a microscope, subject to a high degree of scrutiny as people around you strive to figure out who you are and what you represent as a leader. Opinions of your effectiveness begin to form surprisingly quickly, and, once formed, they’re very hard to change. If you’re successful in building credibility and securing early wins, the momentum likely will propel you through the rest of your tenure. But if you dig yourself into a hole early on, you will face an uphill battle from that point forward.” . Transition其实不仅仅是指跳槽，也可以使同一家公司的升职，职责较大的变动（职位不变），内部转岗，部分重组等等情况。在这个过程中前3个月很大的程度上决定了后面的发展。这让我想到了在看safe withdraw rate (SWR) 博客的时候提到的sequence risk，就是在你退休之后前几年的市场如果进入熊市，那会导致SWR降低很多，换句话说，在转换的期间，无论是事业还是人生阶段，前期事态的顺不顺很大程度上可以预测未来整个过程的走势。万事开头难。 . “Sticking with what you know. You believe you will be successful in the new role by doing the same things you did in your previous role, only more so. You fail to see that success in the new role requires you to stop doing some things and to embrace new competencies.” . 很多人会用过去成功的经验去做面对新的挑战。我觉得这是人的惯性和心里的依赖，甚至失败了也不清楚为什么之前管用的方法，现在新职位为什么就失效了。要用一个全新的心态去接受自己过去的成功经验可能不能直接拿来用，需要做调整，甚至成功的经验并不管用、有副作用，需要”忘记“那些，重头开始学习新技能。 .",

            "content": "“The point of the expectations conversation is for you and your boss to clarify and align your expectations about the future. You need to agree on short- and medium-term goals and on timing. Critically, you need to agree on how your boss will measure progress. What will constitute success, for your boss and for you? When does your boss expect to see results? How will you measure success? Over what time frame? If you succeed, what is next? If you don’t manage expectations, they will manage you.” . 经常聊到manage expectation，这儿讲的比较细。定义中短期的目标，如何定义成功（地完成目标），在什么时间内完全，怎么让老板知道进度。完成目标后下一步是什么。 . “Aim for Early Wins in Areas Important to Your Boss Whatever your own priorities, pinpoint what your boss cares about most, and aim for early wins in those areas. If you want to succeed, you need your boss’s help; in turn, you should help her succeed. When you pay attention to your boss’s priorities, she will feel ownership in your success. The most effective approach is to integrate your boss’s goals with your own efforts to get early wins. If this is impossible, look for early wins based solely on your boss’s priorities.” . 老板的优先级，最想解决的问题就是你最需要解决的问题。如果能和自己的想要做的事结合在一起那当然是最好的。其实以前一直不是彻底理解这个问题，但最近发现老板承受的压力往往是来自同级对他的需求、质疑以及他的老板对他的要求，如果解决了这种要求，那自然你在他心中的地位和信任度也就会增加。 . “Whether you and your boss agree on expectations, try to bias yourself somewhat toward underpromising achievements and overdelivering results. This strategy contributes to building credibility. Consider how your organization’s capacity for change might affect your ability to deliver on the promises you make. Be conservative in what you promise. If you deliver more, you will delight your boss. But if you promise too much and fail to deliver, you risk undermining your credibility. Even if you accomplish a great deal, you will have failed in the boss’s eyes.” . 承诺更少，但完全更多。这在大公司中是常见的，一个很典型的策略是，心里预期一个项目需要1个月完成，那和别人说至少要double。对于整个团队也是，要给团队留足buffer，不要overpromise。 .",

You cannot escape yourself, try as you might. And what reason, other than pure wishful thinking, would you have to suspect that things would be different or better somewhere else anyway? Sooner or later, the same problems would arise if in fact they stem in large part from your patterns of seeing, thinking, and behaving. Too often, our lives cease working because we cease working at life, because we are unwilling to take responsibility for things as they are, and to work with our difficulties. We don’t understand that it is actually possible to attain clarity, understanding, and transformation right in the middle of what is here and now, however problematic it may be. But it is easier and less threatening to our sense of self to project our involvement in our problems onto other people and the environment. It is so much easier to find fault, to blame, to believe that what is needed is a change on the outside, an escape from the forces that are holding you back, preventing you from growing, from finding happiness. You can even blame yourself for it all and, in the ultimate escape from responsibility, run away feeling that you have made a hopeless mess of things, or that you are damaged beyond repair. In either case, you believe that you are incapable of true change or growth, and that you need to spare others any more pain by removing yourself from the scene.” . 这里聊了因果报应、业力、业障。其实理解起来就是，一个人的所作所为，所思所想都是伴随人一生的。很多人或是无法接受，或是责怪外界，或是逃避，或是觉得换个环境就可以重新出发，或是责怪自己觉得无力改变。这种其实是世上真是天天都在发生的，佛学感觉很神秘，什么禅修，密宗等等，但用人话说还是很容易能理解的。 . “There is no successful escaping from yourself in the long run, only transformation. It doesn’t matter whether you are using drugs or meditation, alcohol or Club Med, divorce or quitting your job. There can be no resolution leading to growth until the present situation has been faced completely and you have opened to it with mindfulness, allowing the roughness of the situation itself to sand down your own rough edges. In other words, you must be willing to let life itself become your teacher.” . 既然无法逃避，那就要真正意义上的理解自己所面对的情况，让生活做自己的老师，认真的去审视和理解，这样才有可能找到解决之道。 .",

I like to frame such efforts in question form: “What is my job on the planet with a capital J?”, or, “What do I care about so much that I would pay to do it?” If I ask such a question and I don’t come up with an answer, other than, “I don’t know,” then I just keep asking the question. If you start reflecting on such questions when you’re in your twenties, by the time you are thirty-five or forty, or fifty or sixty, the inquiry itself may have led you a few places that you would not have gone had you merely followed mainstream conventions, or your parents’ expectations for you, or even worse, your own unexamined self-limiting beliefs and expectations.” . “You can start asking this question any time, at any age. There is never a time of life when it would not have a profound effect on your view of things and the choices you make. It may not mean that you will change what you do, but it may mean that you may want to change how you see it or hold it, and perhaps how you do it. Once the universe is your employer, very interesting things start to happen, even if someone else is cutting your paycheck. But you do have to be patient. It takes time to grow this way of being in your life. The place to start of course is right here. The best time? How about now?” . 一直问自己自己来到这个世界真正想要做什么样的工作，不是主流的意见，不是父母的意见，也不是自己没有审查过的想法。这是一个一直会变答案的问题，在不同年龄和经历下会有一系列不同的答案，但答案不是最关键的，关键的是一直问自己这样的问题，然后去实践，反思，调整，再问同样的问题在下一个时空。 . “Here’s how mindfulness changes karma. When you sit, you are not allowing your impulses to translate into action. For the time being, at least, you are just watching them. Looking at them, you quickly see that all impulses in the mind arise and pass away, that they have a life of their own, that they are not you but just thinking, and that you do not have to be ruled by them. Not feeding or reacting to impulses, you come to understand their nature as thoughts directly. This process actually burns up destructive impulses in the fires of concentration and equanimity and non-doing. At the same time, creative insights and creative impulses are no longer squeezed out so much by the more turbulent, destructive ones. They are nourished as they are perceived and held in awareness. Mindfulness can thereby refashion the links in the chain of actions and consequences, and in doing so it unchains us, frees us, and opens up new directions for us through the moments we call life. Without mindfulness, we are all too easily stuck in the momentum coming out of the past, with no clue to our own imprisonment, and no way out. Our dilemma always seems to be the other person’s fault, or the world’s fault, so our own views and feelings are always justified. The present moment is never a new beginning because we keep it from becoming one. How else to explain, for example, the all-too-common observation that two people who have lived their whole adult lives together, had children together, tasted success in their own realms to a degree not usually achieved, might in their later years, when by all accounts they should be enjoying the fruits of their labors, each blame the other for making life miserable, for feeling isolated, trapped in a bad dream, so mistreated and abused that anger and hurt are the fabric of each day? Karma. In one form or another, you see it over and over again in relationships gone sour or missing something fundamental from the start, the absence of which invites sadness, bitterness, hurt. Sooner or later, we are most likely to reap that which we have sown. Practice anger and isolation in a relationship for forty years, and you wind up imprisoned in anger and isolation. No big surprise. And it is hardly satisfactory to apportion blame here. Ultimately, it is our mindlessness that imprisons us. We get better and better at being out of touch with the full range of our possibilities, and more and more stuck in our cultivated-over-a-lifetime habits of not-seeing, but only reacting and blaming.” . 这段写的太好了，就不多做评论了。 .",

Let that time, whatever its length, be a time of being, a time for intentional wakefulness. You don’t want to fill this time with anything other than awareness. No need to go over the day’s commitments in your head and live “ahead” of yourself. This is a time of no-time, of stillness, of presence, of being with yourself. Also, at the moment of waking up, before getting out of bed, get in touch with your breath, feel the various sensations in your body, note any thoughts and feelings that may be present, let mindfulness touch this moment. Can you feel your breathing? Can you perceive the dawning of each in breath? Can you enjoy the feeling of the breath freely entering your body in this moment? Ask yourself: “Am I awake now?” . 每天早上醒来第一个念头是真正让自己醒来，注意互相，注意身体的感受，心里的状态。但现在往往是拿手机，这个和手机放在床边很有关系，需要在新年做一些改变。 . “The virtues of getting up early have nothing to do with cramming more hours of busyness and industry into one’s day. Just the opposite. They stem from the stillness and solitude of the hour, and the potential to use that time to expand consciousness, to contemplate, to make time for being, for purposefully not doing anything. The peacefulness, the darkness, the dawn, the stillness—all contribute to making early morning a special time for mindfulness practice.” . “Waking early has the added value of giving you a very real head start on the day. If you can begin your day with a firm foundation in mindfulness and inner peacefulness, then when you do have to get going and start doing, it is much more likely that the doing will flow out of your being. You are more likely to carry a robust mindfulness, an inner calmness and balance of mind with you throughout the day, than had you just jumped out of bed and started in on the call of demands and responsibilities, however pressing and important.” . 早期不是为了“做”更多的事，而是把时间留给自己，给自己的身体和心里做好准备，更从容地开始外务。 . “We all carry around ideas and images of reality, frequently garnered from other people or from courses we have taken, books we have read, or from television, the radio, newspapers, the culture in general, which give us pictures of how things are and what is occurring. As a result, we often see our thoughts, or someone else’s, instead of seeing what is right in front of us or inside of us. Often, we don’t even bother to look or check how we feel because we think we already know and understand. So we can be closed to the wonder and vitality of fresh encounters. If we are not careful, we can even forget that direct contact is possible. We may lose touch with what is basic and not even know it. We can live in a dream reality of our own making without even a sense of the loss, the gulf, the unnecessary distance we place between ourselves and experience. Not knowing this, we can be all the more impoverished, spiritually and emotionally. But something wonderful and unique can occur when our contact with the world becomes direct.” . 保持好奇心，同样一件事，都有可能带来不同的感受。人很容易陷入：这事我知道了，而忽略了真正背后的感情、深层的事实等等。 .",

            "content": "“Contemplating “What is my Way?” is an excellent element to inject into our meditation practice. We don’t have to come up with answers, nor think that there has to be one particular answer. Better not to think at all. Instead, only persist in asking the question, letting any answers that formulate just come of themselves and go of themselves. As with everything else in the meditation practice, we just watch, listen, note, let be, let go, and keep generating the question, “What is my Way?”, “What is my path?”, “Who am I?” . 不断问自己的道，观察每一个自以为对的答案，观察自己不断地对自己的之前答案的否定，不断得出新的答案。这是一个螺旋上升的过程。 . “Tuning in to your breath when you find yourself lying down. Feel it moving in your entire body. Dwell with the breath in various regions of your body, such as the feet, the legs, the pelvis and genitals, the belly, the chest, the back, the shoulders, the arms, the throat and neck, the head, the face, the top of your head. Listen carefully. Allow yourself to feel whatever is present. Watch the sensations in the body flux and change. Watch your feelings about them flux and change. Try meditating on purpose lying down, not just around bedtime. Do it out of bed, on the floor, at different times of the day. Do it in fields and meadows on occasion, under trees, in the rain, in the snow.” . 禅宗的出、入、息。息和这里说的Dwell with the breath很类似，在呼和下一次吸中间停住的时间。 . “Changing the filter, wiping noses, going to meetings, picking up around the house, washing dishes, checking the dipstick—don’t let yourself think these are distracting you from your more serious pursuits. Such a round of chores is not a set of difficulties we hope to escape from so that we may do our “practice” which will put us on a “path”—it is our path.” . 做“杂事”并不是修炼的阻碍，而是修炼本身，就像少林寺也有各种杂事要做，也不是天天打坐的。 . “Instead, we watch television at the end of the day, a pale electronic fire energy, and pale in comparison. We submit ourselves to constant bombardment by sounds and images that come from minds other than our own, that fill our heads with information and trivia, other people’s adventures and excitement and desires. Watching television leaves even less room in the day for experiencing stillness. It soaks up time, space, and silence, a soporific, lulling us into mindless passivity. “Bubble gum for the eyes,” Steve Allen called it. Newspapers do much the same. They are not bad in themselves, but we frequently conspire to use them to rob ourselves of many precious moments in which we might be living more fully.” . 这里让我想起了自己几年前，吃饭的时候也要看各种下饭视频，食不知味。过去在作者写书的时代是电视，报纸，占据了大量的时间，现在是互联网资讯，短视频，占据了更多的碎片化时间，挤占了我们和自己相处的时间，和家人相处的时间，收获的往往是一时的快感。 .",

He had often heard all this before, all these numerous voices in the river, but today they sounded different. He could no longer distinguish the different voices—the merry voice from the weeping voice, the childish voice from the manly voice. They all belonged to each other: the lament of those who yearn, the laughter of the wise, the cry of indignation and the groan of the dying. They were all interwoven and interlocked, entwined in a thousand ways. And all the voices, all the goals, all the pleasures, all the good and evil, all of them together was the world. All of them together was the stream of events, the music of life. When Siddhartha listened attentively to this river, to this song of a thousand voices, when he did not listen to the sorrow or the laughter, when he did not bind his soul to any one particular voice and absorb it in his Self, but heard them all, the whole, the unity, then the great song of a thousand voices consisted of one word.” . 最近在看《南禅七日》的视频，里面有一段是观世音菩萨讲自己的修炼就是从音声而入到。“反闻闻自性，性成无上道”：道是在你本心处，不是在佛那里，如果心里不清净就听不见音声了，空就能听见了，假设心里有个烦恼或痛苦挡住了，那就什么也听不见。 . “Sitting still or lying still, in any moment we can reconnect with our body, transcend the body, merge with the breath, with the universe, experience ourselves as whole and folded into larger and larger wholes. A taste of interconnectedness brings deep knowledge of belonging, a sense of being an intimate part of things, a sense of being at home wherever we are. We may taste and wonder at an ancient timelessness beyond birth and death, and simultaneously experience the fleeting brevity of this life as we pass through it, the impermanence of our ties to our body, to this moment, to each other. Knowing our wholeness directly in the meditation practice, we may find ourselves coming to terms with things as they are, a deepening of understanding and compassion, a lessening of anguish and despair.” . 个人和宇宙全体的联系，个人生命的短暂，但作为宇宙整体的永恒。让我想起了赤壁赋里苏轼说的：盖将自其变者而观之，则天地曾不能以一瞬；自其不变者而观之，则物与我皆无尽也，而又何羡乎。 .",

Awareness is more like a vessel which can hold and contain our thinking, helping us to see and know our thoughts as thoughts rather than getting caught up in them as reality.” . 自知和思维/想法是不一样的。自知更像是一个容器承载和观察着思维和想法的生灭。以第三视角看待自己的想法，但又不同于真正的第三视角，自知其实是有能力理解所有的想法的，只是需要去主动深挖。 . “Dwelling inwardly for extended periods, we come to know something of the poverty of always looking outside ourselves for happiness, understanding, and wisdom. It’s not that God, the environment, and other people cannot help us to be happy or to find satisfaction. It’s just that our happiness, satisfaction, and our understanding, even of God, will be no deeper than our capacity to know ourselves inwardly, to encounter the outer world from the deep comfort that comes from being at home in one’s own skin, from an intimate familiarity with the ways of one’s own mind and body.” . 从外界是可以索取知识、快乐的trigger、智慧等等，但如果没有内化到自身，那也没有办法真正产生宁静、快乐和智慧。 . “For those seeking balance in their lives, a certain flexibility of approach is not only helpful, it is essential. It is important to know that meditation has little to do with clock time. Five minutes of formal practice can be as profound or more so than forty-five minutes. The sincerity of your effort matters far more than elapsed time, since we are really talking about stepping out of minutes and hours and into moments, which are truly dimensionless and therefore infinite. So, if you have some motivation to practice even a little, that is what is important. Mindfulness needs to be kindled and nurtured, protected from the winds of a busy life or a restless and tormented mind, just as a small flame needs to be sheltered from strong gusts of air.” . 冥想其实不用做下来完全不受打扰地15分钟，和世界时间没有关系，是自己的内心能不能真正“停下来”审视自己。即使只有5分钟、1分钟，不断地联系是非常重要的。 .",

Only the strength of such a dynamic vision and the motivation from which it springs can possibly keep you on this path year in and year out, with a willingness to practice every day and to bring mindfulness to bear on whatever is happening, to open to whatever is perceived, and to let it point to where the holding is and where the letting go and the growing need to happen.” . 想要长期坚持冥想，必须要给自己找到一个自己相信的价值、愿景、方向。这个是可以不断调整的，通过冥想可以了解自己的处境，需要放弃什么，需要在什么方面成长。 . “Asking yourself why you meditate or why you want to meditate. Don’t believe your first answers. Just write down a list of whatever comes to mind. Continue asking yourself. Also, inquire about your values, about what you honor most in life. Make a list of what is really important to you. Ask yourself: What is my vision, my map for where I am and where I am going? Does this vision reflect my true values and intentions? Am I remembering to embody those values? Do I practice my intentions? How am I now in my job, in my family, in my relationships, with myself? How do I want to be? How might I live my vision, my values? How do I relate to suffering, both my own and others’?” . 这段其实和上一段类似。冥想一次很容易，但要长期坚持，并为之找到意义在开始前其实需要想清楚一些事，然后不断通过冥想来审视之前的答案。 . “The message is that getting caught up in the normal human tendencies of self-cherishing and arrogance, and ignoring the larger order of things, will ultimately lead to an impasse in your life in which you are unable to go forward, unable to go back, and unable to turn around. ” . 自大和无知是非常危险的事，往往会让自己陷入进退失据的局面。就比如，一直呆在一个夕阳产业，而不选择寻找其他出入。 .",

Give more than you think you can, trusting that you are richer than you think. Celebrate this richness. Give as if you had inexhaustible wealth. This is called “kingly giving.” I am not talking solely of money or material possessions, although it can be wonderfully growth-enhancing, uplifting, and truly helpful to share material abundance. Rather, what is being suggested here is that you practice sharing the fullness of your being, your best self, your enthusiasm, your vitality, your spirit, your trust, your openness, above all, your presence. Share it with yourself, with your family, with the world.” . 传说中的传递正能量。影响自己，影响他人，影响世界。钱和物质上的捐赠并不是重点，通过做更好的自己，分享自己的热爱，活力，精神，信任，开放，是可以从精神层面激励数不清的人的。 . “Voluntary simplicity means going fewer places in one day rather than more, seeing less so I can see more, doing less so I can do more, acquiring less so I can have more. It all ties in. ” . 做减法其实也是一种加法，少做不同的事，少看不同的东西，其实就可以更多地把时间花在重要的事、东西和自身上。 . “I practice saying no to keep my life simple, and I find I never do it enough. It’s an arduous discipline all its own, and well worth the effort. Yet it is also tricky. There are needs and opportunities to which one must respond. A commitment to simplicity in the midst of the world is a delicate balancing act. It is always in need of retuning, further inquiry, attention. But I find the notion of voluntary simplicity keeps me mindful of what is important, of an ecology of mind and body and world in which everything is interconnected and every choice has far-reaching consequences. You don’t get to control it all. But choosing simplicity whenever possible adds to life an element of deepest freedom which so easily eludes us, and many opportunities to discover that less may actually be more.” . 这作者也说了做减法、说“不”是一门艺术，很多时候会身不由己。当你开始一件事儿的时候，它可能为你的未来带来了无数的责任，而往往很多事的诱惑力又太大，人又不可能完全脱离凡事，所以如何有纪律地取舍真的很重要。 .",

Action then becomes a pure expression of art, of being, of letting go of all doing—a merging of mind and body in motion. We thrill in watching a superb performance, whether athletic or artistic, because it allows us to participate in the magic of true mastery, to be uplifted, if only briefly, and perhaps to share in the intention that each of us, in our own way, might touch such moments of grace and harmony in the living of our own lives.” . 任何一件事做到极致都是看上去完全不用力气的，身心合一，顺应着内在的规律去做事。 . “We can apprentice ourselves to this work, knowing full well that non-doing is truly the work of a lifetime; and conscious all the while that the doing mode is usually so strong in us that the cultivating of non-doing ironically takes considerable effort.” . non-doing在中文版的翻译是无为。无为并不是什么都不做，而是顺应规律去用最合理的方式去做。 . “Scratch the surface of impatience and what you will find lying beneath it, subtly or not so subtly, is anger.

Laws are passed to cause people to pay their taxes, not to steal, and to honor contracts with strangers. Each of these activities could be regarded as a giant Prisoner’s Dilemma game with many players. No one wants to pay taxes because the benefits are so diffuse and the costs are so direct. But everyone may be better off if each person has to pay so that each can share the benefits of schools, roads, and other collective goods (Schelling 1973). This is a major part of what Rousseau meant when he said that government’s role is to make sure that each citizen “will be forced to be free” . 其实还可以从法律改变了囚徒困境的payout，让背叛的收益相比较合作来说没有那么大，甚至低于合作的收益。就比如收税，如果逃税被抓会被罚到破产，那就会降低逃税的欲望。 . “The question about the value of information can also be turned around: what is the value (or cost) of having other players know your strategy? The answer, of course, depends on exactly what strategy you are using. If you are using an exploitable strategy, such as TIT FOR TWO TATS, the cost can be substantial. On the other hand, if you are using a strategy that is best met with complete cooperation, then you might be glad to have your strategy known to the other. For example, if you were using TIT FOR TAT, you would be happy to have the other player appreciate this fact and adapt to it, provided, of course, that the shadow of the future is large enough so that the best response is a nice strategy. In fact, as has been said, one of the advantages of TIT FOR TAT is that it is easy for it to be recognized in the course of a game even if the player using it has not yet established a reputation.” . 当策略是有可以被剥削的时候，不让别人知道你的策略很重要，但一个策略如果是不能被剥削的，那就是“阳谋”，即使别人知道你下一步会怎么做，仍然得选择合作 . “A government must deter its citizens from breaking the law. For example, to collect taxes effectively, a government must maintain a reputation for prosecuting tax evaders. The government often spends far more investigating and prosecuting evaders than it acquires from the penalties levied against them. The government’s goal, of course, is to maintain a reputation for catching and prosecuting evaders to deter anyone contemplating tax evasion in the future. And what is true for tax collection is also true for many forms of policing: the key to maintaining compliant behavior from the citizenry is that the government remains able and willing to devote resources far out of proportion to the stakes of the current issue in order to maintain its reputation for toughness.” . 杀鸡儆猴的作用，有时候动用的资源和成本远大于收益，但为了预防大面积的背叛，还是有必要做的。就比如现在中国队立陶宛的策略。 .",

In other words, too much complexity can appear to be total chaos. If you are using a strategy which appears random, then you also appear unresponsive to the other player. If you are unresponsive, then the other player has no incentive to cooperate with you. So being so complex as to be incomprehensible is very dangerous.” . 当策略过于复杂以至于对手区分不了你在用什么策略，对于对手来说他就判断不准你会怎么行动，会导致没有动力和你合作。所以有时候耍小聪明，让别人摸不透也不是件好事。说到底还是那句话，目的是让自己到达最好，如何使得对手有动力和你合作共赢才是关键，而不是显示自己有多聪明。 . “One way to account for TIT FOR TAT’s great success in the tournament is that it has great clarity: it is eminently comprehensible to the other player. When you are using TIT FOR TAT, the other player has an excellent chance of understanding what you are doing. Your one-for-one response to any defection is an easy pattern to appreciate. Your future behavior can then be predicted. Once this happens, the other player can easily see that the best way to deal with TIT FOR TAT is to cooperate with it. Assuming that the game is sufficiently likely to continue for at least one more interaction, there is no better plan when meeting a TIT FOR TAT strategy than to cooperate now so that you will be the recipient of a cooperation on the very next move.” . TIT FOR TAT成功的关键之一就是策略非常明白，是一种公开了和你玩，你不得不配合的阳谋。 . “The advice dealing with how this mutual cooperation can be promoted comes in three categories: making the future more important relative to the present; changing the payoffs to the players of the four possible outcomes of a move; and teaching the players values, facts, and skills that will promote cooperation.” . 如何促进合作：1.增加未来合作的可能性和持久度 2.改变各种情况的奖惩额度，比如合作本身就能比背叛获得更多利益 3. 通过教育价值、事实和技能来让大家明白合作的好处。 .",

It is important to bear in mind that TIT FOR TAT is a stable strategy only when the discount parameter, w, is high enough relative to the payoff parameters, R, S, T, and P. In particular, proposition 2 shows that if the discount parameter is not high enough and the other player is using TIT FOR TAT, a player is better off alternating defection and cooperation, or even always defecting. Therefore, if the other player is not likely to be seen again, defecting right away is better than being nice.” . TIT FOR TAT表现好是有条件的，必须和对方有长久对局的可能性。当这个可能性降低，也就意味着可能这是一次性囚徒困境，那选择背叛测试最佳的策略。 . “The moral of the story is that the precise level of forgiveness that is optimal depends upon the environment. In particular, if the main danger is unending mutual recriminations, then a generous level of forgiveness is appropriate. But, if the main danger is from strategies that are good at exploiting easygoing rules, then an excess of forgiveness is costly. While the exact balance will be hard to determine in a given environment, the evidence of the tournament suggests that something approaching a one-for-one response to defection is likely to be quite efFective in a wide range of settings. Therefore it is good advice to a player to reciprocate defection as well as cooperation. ” . 报复的程度是取决于所在环境（对手）是否倾向于剥削策略还是报复策略。如果是剥削的话，那就要N报还1报（N&gt;=1)，如果是报复策略，为了防止一直持续的相互报复（冤冤相报何时了），就要那就要N报还1报（N&lt;=1). .",

            "content": "“The chronological story that emerges from this analysis is the following. ALL D is the primeval state and is evolu-tionarily stable. But cooperation based on reciprocity can gain a foothold through two different mechanisms. First, there can be kinship between mutant strategies, giving the genes of the mutants some stake in each other’s success, thereby altering the payoff of the interaction when viewed from the perspective of the gene rather than the individual. A second mechanism to overcome total defection is for the mutant strategies to arrive in a cluster so that they provide a nontrivial proportion of the interactions each has, even if they are so few as to provide a negligible proportion of the interactions which the ALL D individuals have. Then the tournament approach described in chapter 2 demonstrates that once a variety of strategies is present, TIT FOR TAT is an extremely robust one. It does well in a wide range of circumstances and gradually displaces all other strategies in an ecological simulation that contains a great variety of more or less sophisticated decision rules. And if the probability that interaction between two individuals will continue is great enough, then TIT FOR TAT is an extremely robust one. It does well in a wide range of circumstances and gradually displaces all other strategies in an ecological simulation that contains a great variety of more or less sophisticated decision rules. And if the probability that interaction between two individuals will continue is great enough, then TIT FOR TAT is itself evolution-arily stable. Moreover, its stability is especially secure because it can resist the intrusion of whole clusters of mutant strategies. Thus cooperation based on reciprocity can get started in a predominantly noncooperative world, can thrive in a variegated environment, and can defend itself once fully established.” . 这里聊了TIT FOR TAT如何能在恶劣的环境中生根，一种是亲属间的互惠，另一种就是群落都适用TIT FOR TAT可以入侵全部背叛的策略。当入侵成功后，其他人会发现TIA FOR TAT的策略优势而逐渐调整自己的策略成为TIT FOR TAT。 . “TIT FOR TAT won the tournament because it did well in its interactions with a wide variety of other strategies. On average, it did better than any other rule with the other strategies in the tournament. Yet TIT FOR TAT never once scored better in a game than the other player! In fact, it can’t. It lets the other player defect first, and it never defects more times than the other player has defected. Therefore, TIT FOR TAT achieves either the same score as the other player, or a little less. TIT FOR TAT won the tournament, not by beating the other player, but by eliciting behavior from the other player which allowed both to do well. TIT FOR TAT was so consistent at eliciting mutually rewarding outcomes that it attained a higher overall score than any other strategy. So in a non-zero-sum world you do not have to do better than the other player to do well for yourself. This is especially true when you are interacting with many different players. Letting each of them do the same or a little better than you is fine, as long as you tend to do well yourself. There is no point in being envious of the success of the other player, since in an iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma of long duration the other’s success is virtually a prerequisite of your doing well for yourself.” . 这点非常有启发。TIT FOR TAT赢了所有锦标赛，但从来没有比任何一个对手得过更高的分，因为TIT FOR TAT永远不会第一个背叛，但总得分却是最高的，因为TIT FOR TAT能让对局双方都往合作的方向发展。在不是零和游戏中，目标不是赢过或者嫉妒某一个人，而是做到自己最好。 .",

If a nice strategy were not provoked by a defection on move n, then it would not be collectively stable because it could be invaded by a rule which defected only on move n.” . 这里解释了为什么一定要在背叛后惩罚对方（复仇）来达到stable，就是因为如果有一种策略只在n轮背叛，如果你不惩罚它，那就会被入侵。 . “This proposition has important implications for the evolution of cooperation. If one imagines a system starting with individuals who cannot be enticed to cooperate, the collective stability of ALL D implies that no single individual can hope to do any better than go along and be uncooperative as well. A world of “meanies” can resist invasion by anyone using any other strategy—provided that the newcomers arrive one at a time. The problem, of course, is that a single newcomer in such a mean world has no one who will reciprocate any cooperation. If the newcomers arrive in small clusters, however, they will have a chance to get cooperation started.” . “If a TIT FOR TAT has some proportion, p, of its interactions with other TIT FOR TAT players, it will have 1–p with the meanies. So its average score will be 30p + 9(1–p). If this score is more than 10 points, it pays to use a TIT FOR TAT strategy rather than be a meanie like the bulk of the population. And this will be true even if only 5 percent of the interactions of the TIT FOR TAT players are with other TIT FOR TAT players.8 Thus, even a small cluster of TIT FOR TAT players can get a higher average score than the large population of meanies they enter. Because the TIT FOR TAT players do so well when they do meet each other, they do not have to meet each other very often to make their strategy the superior one to use.” . 这里说了一个很有意思的事，ALL D：全部背叛的策略是stable的regardless of w （折现率）。这种策略可以抵御任何单个策略的入侵，因为合作得不到任何回报。但是只要有一小群同样的策略，比如TIT FOR TAT，内部能有5%的互动率，那就可以达到比ALL D更好的表现 .",

Its niceness prevents it from getting into unnecessary trouble. Its retaliation discourages the other side from persisting whenever defection is tried. Its forgiveness helps restore mutual cooperation. And its clarity makes it intelligible to the other player, thereby eliciting long-term cooperation.” . TIT FOR TAT的四点属性，不首先欺骗，有仇必报，报酬后会选择原谅，以及非常容易辨认的策略。其实就是一种阳谋，告诉对方自己的策略，有理智的玩家自然会辨认出长期合作对双方都是最好的选择。 . “Just how broadly applicable was the proposition about TIT FOR TAT which said that it was collectively stable if and only if the future of the interaction was sufficiently important? The next proposition says that this result is very general indeed, and actually applies to any strategy which may be the first to cooperate.” . 这里指的stable是说，假设所有玩家都使用一个策略，那这个策略是stable当且仅当另一个玩家使用一种其他任何策略加入游戏时，那种策略无法取得等好的成绩。TIT FOR TAT或是任何选择首先合作的策略，都需要未来轮次的重要性足够高，换句话说，会有长期交往的可能性，而不是一锤子买卖。 . “The reason is that for a strategy to be collectively stable it must protect itself from invasion by any challenger, including the strategy which always defects. If the native strategy ever cooperates, ALL D will get T on that move. On the other hand, the population average among the natives can be no greater than R per move. So in order for the population average to be no less than the score of the challenging ALL D, the interaction must last long enough for the gain from temptation to be nullified over future moves.” . 这里更具体地解释了原因，假设一个入侵策略是全部背叛的话，为了使得第一次背叛的多出来的收益被抵消，那么未来就要有足够多的轮次通过彼此互相合作的收益来弥补。 .",

If, on the other hand, a decision rule’s success derives from its ability to exploit other rules, then as these exploited rules die out, the exploiter’s base of support becomes eroded and the exploiter suffers a similar fate.” . “The ecological analysis shows that doing well with rules that do not score well themselves is eventually a self-defeating process. Not being nice may look promising at first, but in the long run it can destroy the very environment it needs for its own success.” . . 当一个策略是靠着剥削其他不好的策略而获益时，短期在环境中那些不好的策略还存在时，会有较好的收益，长期当那些不好的策略别筛选了，那靠剥削的策略也会衰亡。 . “Proposition 1 says that there is no absolutely best rule independent of the environment. What can be said for the empirical successes of TIT FOR TAT is that it is a very robust rule: it does very well over a wide range of environments. Part of its success might be that other rules anticipate its presence and are designed to do well with it. Doing well with TIT FOR TAT requires cooperating with it, and this in turn helps TIT FOR TAT. Even rules like TESTER that were designed to see what they could get away with, quickly apologize to TIT FOR TAT. Any rule which tries to take advantage of TIT FOR TAT will simply hurt itself. TIT FOR TAT benefits from its own nonexploitability because three conditions are satisfied: . The possibility of encountering TIT FOR TAT is salient. | Once encountered, TIT FOR TAT is easy to recognize. | Once recognized, TIT FOR TAT’s nonexploitability is easy to appreciate.” | 这里聊了TIT FOR TAT之所以表现很好的原因，这种策略存在的可能性非常大，另外策略很容易辨认出TIT FOR TAT，当发现对方用TIT FOR TAT那么知道无法剥削对方，那为了使自己的利益最大化，那就只能选择合作。 .",

Put another way, does TIT FOR TAT do well in a wide variety of environments? That is to say, is it robust? A good way to examine this question is to construct a series of hypothetical tournaments, each with a very different distribution of the types of rules participating. The method of constructing these drastically modified tournaments is explained in appendix A. The results were that TIT FOR TAT won five of the six major variants of the tournament, and came in second in the sixth. This is a strong test of how robust the success of TIT FOR TAT really is.” . 令我感到惊讶的是，一个很简单的策略赢了两轮竞标赛，参与者都是相关行业的大师。赢的策略叫做TIT FOR TAT：第一次遇到任何玩家都选择合作，下一次遇到同个玩家就执行这个玩家上次的动作，比如上次是背叛，那我这次就背叛，上次是合作，这次就合作。这个策略的成功并不是偶然，主办方还做了6次模拟，每次模拟选取了不同策略分布（比如有一些竞标赛，不合作的策略多，有一些合作的策略多），6次竞标赛中TIT FOR TAT 5次冠军1次亚军，证明了它在不同环境中的鲁棒性。后面会有详细的分析为什么这种策略能成功，以及现实中的应用案例。 .",

A single player may be interacting with many others, but the player is assumed to be interacting with them one at a time.3 The player is also assumed to recognize another player and to remember how the two of them have interacted so far. This ability to recognize and remember allows the history of the particular interaction to be taken into account by a player’s strategy. A variety of ways to resolve the Prisoner’s Dilemma have been developed. Each involves allowing some additional activity that alters the strategic interaction in such a way as to fundamentally change the nature of the problem. The original problem remains, however, because there are many situations in which these remedies are not available. Therefore, the problem will be considered in its fundamental form, without these alterations. . There is no mechanism available to the players to make enforceable threats or commitments (Schelling 1960). Since the players cannot commit themselves to a particular strategy, each must take into account all possible strategies that might be used by the other player. Moreover the players have all possible strategies available to themselves | There is no way to be sure what the other player will do on a given move. This eliminates the possibility of rne-tagame analysis (Howard 1971) which allows such options as “make the same choice as the other is about to make.” It also eliminates the possibility of reliable reputations such as might be based on watching the other player interact with third parties. Thus the only information available to the players about each other is the history of their interaction so far. | There is no way to eliminate the other player or run away from the interaction. Therefore each player retains the ability to cooperate or defect on each move. | There is no way to change the other player’s payoffs. The payoffs already include whatever consideration each player has for the interests of the other (Taylor 1976, pp. 69-73).” | 这里提了一下研究的iterative prisoner dillema的定义。一个玩家同时和另一个进行游戏，但每一轮可能和不同玩家进行。玩家间能相互确认身份并了解之前的相互间之前玩过的轮次记录，但不能看到对方和其他玩家的历史记录。玩家之间不能相互强迫做出选择，每一次选择都是独立的选择，相互没办法完全预判选择。每个选择必须要做出合作或者背叛。每轮的结果是固定的。 . “The analysis of the data from these tournaments reveals four properties which tend to make a decision rule successful: avoidance of unnecessary conflict by cooperating as long as the other player does, provocability in the face of an uncalled for defection by the other, forgiveness after responding to a provocation, and clarity of behavior so that the other player can adapt to your pattern of action.” . 在很多玩家参与的游戏中，优秀的策略满足一下几个特性： . 不先背叛 | 面对一次背叛，立即会在下次面对同一个玩家时进行包袱 | 报复后会选择原谅 | 自己的策略很容易能让对方理解并一次选择对方的策略（而使得他自己的长期利益能够最大化） | .",

Yet we also know that cooperation does occur and that our civilization is based upon it. But, in situations where each individual has an incentive to be selfish, how can cooperation ever develop?” “The approach of this book is to investigate how individuals pursuing their own interests will act, followed by an analysis of what effects this will have for the system as a whole. Put another way, the approach is to make some assumptions about individual motives and then deduce consequences for the behavior of the entire system (Schelling 1978). The case of the U.S. Senate is a good example, but the same style of reasoning can be applied to other settings.” . 人总是先思考自身利益的，那人们为什么又会合作呢？当然是因为合作长期带来的利益大于个人的利益。 . “The definition of Prisoner’s Dilemma requires that several relationships hold among the four different potential outcomes. The first relationship specifies the order of the four payoffs. The best a player can do is get T, the temptation to defect when the ther player cooperates. The worst a player can do is get S, the sucker’s payoff for cooperating while the other player defects. In ordering the other two outcomes, R, the reward for mutual cooperation, is “assumed to be better than P, the punishment for mutual defection. This leads to a preference ranking of the four payoffs from best to worst as T, R, P, and S. The second part of the definition of the Prisoner’s Dilemma is that the players cannot get out of their dilemma by taking turns exploiting each other. This assumption means that an even chance of exploitation and being exploited is not as good an outcome for a player as mutual cooperation. It is therefore assumed that the reward for mutual cooperation is greater than the average of the temptation and the sucker’s payoff. This assumption, together with the rank ordering of the four payoffs, defines the Prisoner’s Dilemma.” . 囚徒困境专业版定义。首先，一方背叛一方合作的收益背叛方是T, 合作方是S，T是最大值，S是最小值。当双方都合作时，收益是R，双方背叛时收益是P，R是大于P但小于T，而P是大于S的。同时囚徒困境并不能通过互相剥削来获得更大的收益，具体来说就是T+S&lt;2*R. . “If the game is played a known finite number of times, the players still have no incentive to cooperate. This is certainly true on the last move since there is no future to influence. On the next-to-last move neither player will have an incentive to cooperate since they can both anticipate a defection by the other player on the very last move. Such a line of reasoning implies that the game will unravel all the way back to mutual defection on the first move of any sequence of plays that is of known finite length (Luce and Raiffa 1957, pp. 94-102), This reasoning does not apply if the players will interact an indefinite number of times. And in most realistic settings, the players cannot be sure when the last interaction between them will take place. As will be shown later, with an indefinite number of interactions, cooperation can emerge. The issue then becomes the discovery of the precise conditions that are necessary and sufficient for cooperation to emerge.” . 这里描述了一个很有意思的场景。如果是有限次的囚徒困境，理智双方是不可能达成合作的：最后一次肯定是要选择背叛的，因此倒数第二次因为大家都明白最后一次是选择背叛，所以当下选择合作并不能换来未来的收益，所以也是选择背叛，以此类推。但当人们不确定未来还要进行多少次合作、背叛选择的话，那合作就会产生。 .",

            "content": "Asset/currency holders typically worry that policy makers will impose restrictions on their ability to get their money out of the country, which encourages them to get their money out while they still can, which further increases the balance of payments problem. Policy makers worry about capital outflows and the possibility of a currency collapse. As the balance of payments deteriorate, the central bank’s job becomes more difficult—i.e., it gets less economic growth per unit of inflation because the negative flows lead the currency to depreciate, interest rates to rise, and/or reserves to decline, depending on how the central bank chooses to handle it. . 当一个国家的人民想把钱转移到更安全的资产、货币中时，会导致一个国家对外债还款能力的下降（因为外汇贮备降低），当资金流出成为主流，本国货币会贬值，国内利率需要上升（来减缓流出的趋势），外汇储备下降。 . At this stage, central banks typically try to defend their currencies by a) filling the balance of payments deficit by spending down reserves and/or b) raising rates. These currency defenses and managed currency declines rarely work because the selling of reserves and/or the raising of interest rates creates more of an opportunity for sellers, while it doesn’t move the currencies and interest rates to the levels that they need to be to bring about sustainable economic conditions. Let’s look at this typical defense and why it fails. . There is a critical relationship between a) the interest rate difference and b) the spot/forward currency relationship. The amount the currency is expected to decline is priced into how much less the forward price is below the spot price. For example, if the market expects the currency to fall by 5 percent over a year, it will need that currency to yield a 5 percent higher interest rate. The math is even starker when depreciation is expected over short periods of time. If the market expects a 5 percent depreciation over a month, than it will need that currency to yield a 5 percent higher interest rate over that month—and a 5 percent monthly interest is equivalent to an annual interest rate of about 80 percent—a level that’s likely to produce a very severe economic contraction in an already weak economy. Because a small expected currency depreciation (say 5 to 10 percent in a year) would equal a large interest rate premium (5 to 10 percent per year higher), this path is intolerable. . Said differently, a managed currency decline accompanied by falling reserves causes the market to expect continued future currency depreciation, which pushes up domestic interest rates (as described above), acting as a tightening at a time when the economy is already weak. Also, the expectation of continued devaluation will encourage increased capital withdrawals and devaluation speculation, widening the balance of payments gap and forcing the central bank to spend down more reserves to defend the currency (or abandon the planned gradual depreciation). Also, a currency defense by spending reserves will have to stop because no sensible policy maker will want to run out of such “savings.” In such currency defenses, policy makers—especially those defending a peg—will typically make boldly confident statements vowing to stop the currency from weakening. All of these things classically happen just before the cycle moves to its next stage, which is letting the currency go. . 这几段还是挺经典的。当货币贬值，假设一年后贬值5%，想要保持不贬值，那就预期5%的利率提升，这会进一步导致经济的衰弱。而且人们的预期和羊群效应会发生，倒是可能贬值的速度是每个月5%，那提升利率的做法就没办法阻挡货币贬值。央行想要用外汇储备来还钱也是长期不现实的，毕竟那是有限资源挡不住大势。 .",

            "content": "As the bubble emerges, there are fewer productive investments, and at the same time there is more capital going after them. The fundamental attractiveness of the country that sparked the boom fades, in part because the rising currency is eroding the country’s competitiveness. . During this stage, growth is increasingly financed by debt rather than productivity gains, and the country typically becomes highly reliant on foreign financing. This shows up in foreign currency denominated debt rising. These emerging countries typically borrow primarily from abroad with debts denominated in foreign currencies because of a combination of factors—including the local financial system not being well developed, less faith in lending in the local currency, and a smaller stock of domestic savings available to be lent out. . 这里讲的情况其实挺像当年东南亚四小龙、四小虎的情况的，美元最后1997年收割一波20年的经济成果。 . Below we summarize the conditions through the upswings that led to the 27 inflationary deleveragings we looked at. We break out the cases with higher and lower levels of foreign-denominated debt and the cases that eventually had the least and most extreme economic outcomes (as measured by most severe declines in growth and equity prices and increases in unemployment and inflation). As you will see, the countries that were most externally reliant through the upswing and experienced the biggest asset bubbles ultimately experienced the most painful outcomes. . 这儿总结了几个技术性的指标，针对通胀型去杠杆（一般是发展中国家），可以看到外债一本都是很多的，外汇储备一般也有GDP的10%，资本流入占GDP的10~20%。 . In the typical cycle, the crisis arises because the unsustainable pace of capital that drove the bubble slows, but in many cases, there is some sort of a shock (like a decline in oil prices for an oil producer). Generally the causes of the top-reversal fall into a few categories: 1) The income from selling goods and services to foreigners drops (e.g., the currency has risen to a point where it’s made the country’s exports expensive; commodity-exporting countries may suffer from a fall in commodity prices). 2) The costs of items bought from abroad or the cost of borrowing rises. 3) Declines in capital flows coming into the country (e.g., foreign investors reduce their net lending or net investment into the country). This occurs because: a) The unsustainable pace naturally slows, b) Something leads to greater worries about economic or political conditions, or c) A tightening of monetary policy in the local currency and/or in the currency those debts are denominated in (or in some cases, tightening abroad creates pressure for foreign capital to pull out of the country). 4) A country’s own citizens or companies want to get their money out of their country/currency. Weakening capital flows are often the first shoe to drop in a balance of payments crisis. They directly cause growth to weaken because the investment and consumption they had been financing is reduced. This makes domestic borrowers seem less creditworthy, which makes foreigners less willing to lend and provide capital. So, the weakening is self-reinforcing. •• Growth slows relative to potential as the pace of capital inflows slows. •• Domestic capital outflows pick up a bit. •• Export earnings fall, due to falling prices or falling quantities sold. Typically exports are flat, no longer rising. . 当泡沫即将破裂会有集中信号： . 出口减少（因为货币的升值导致价格竞争力下降） | 进口成本变高或者借外债成本变高 | 外国资本因多种原因流入的速度变慢，甚至流出（比如美元利息变好） | 国民信心下降导致想把资产转移 |",

            "content": "The bubble emerges in the midst of a self-reinforcing virtuous cycle of strong capital flows, good asset returns, and strong economic conditions. The capital that came in during the early upswing produced good returns, as it was invested productively and led to asset price appreciation, which attracted even more capital. In the bubble phase, the prices of the currency and/or the assets get bid up and increasingly financed by debt, making the prices of these investments too high to produce adequate returns, but the borrowing and buying continues because prices are rising, and so debts rise rapidly relative to incomes. . When there is a big wave of money coming into (and/or staying in) a country/currency, typically the exchange rate is strong, foreign-exchange reserves increase, and the economy booms—or in some cases the currency rises a lot and the economy grows more slowly. This upswing tends to be self-reinforcing until it is so overdone that it reverses. It is self-reinforcing because the inflows drive up the currency, making it desirable to hold assets denominated in it (and desirable to hold liabilities denominated in other currencies), and/or produce more money creation that causes prices to rise more. . In either case, during these bubbles the total returns of these assets to foreigners (i.e., asset prices in local currency plus the currency appreciation) are very attractive. That plus that country’s hot economic activity encourage more foreign inflows and fewer domestic outflows. Over time, the country becomes the hot place to invest, and its assets become overbought so debt and stock-market bubbles emerge. Investors believe the country’s assets are a fabulous treasure to own and that anyone not in the country is missing out. Investors who were never involved with the market rush in. When the market gets fully long, leveraged, and overpriced, it becomes ripe for a reversal. In the bullets here and in the ones that follow, we show some key economic developments typically seen as the bubble inflates. •• Foreign capital flows are high (on average around 10 percent of GDP) •• The central bank is accumulating foreign-exchange reserves •• The real FX is bid up and becomes overvalued on a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis by around 15 percent •• Stocks rally (on average by over 20 percent for several years into their peak) . 简单几句话就介绍了泡沫产生的原理：一开始投资被高效的使用，资产价格、收益都很吸引人，导致更多的资本（国内、国外）流入这个国家，货币同时也强势升值，导致更多的国际资本愿意持有这种货币的资产。当资产价格被推高到一定程度（4个指标），导致底层的收益以及产生的产品和服务不能支持如此高的估值，以及很多投资的成本、杠杆变高，这些都造成了泡沫的出现。 .",

            "content": "If a currency falls in relation to another currency at a rate that is greater than the currency’s interest rate, the holder of the debt in the weakening currency will lose money. If investors expect that weakness to continue without being compensated with higher interest rates, a dangerous currency dynamic will develop. . That last dynamic, i.e., the currency dynamic, is what produces inflationary depressions. Holders of debt denominated in the poorly returning currency are motivated to sell it and move their assets into another currency or a non-currency store hold of wealth like gold. When there is a debt crisis and economic weakness in a country, it is typically impossible for the central bank to raise interest rates enough to compensate for the currency weakness, so the money leaves that country and currency for safer countries. When so much money leaves the country that lending dries up, the central bank is faced with the choice of letting the credit markets tighten or printing money, which produces a lot of it. While it is widely known that central banks manage the trade-offs between inflation and growth by changing interest rates and liquidity in the system, what is not widely known is that the central bank’s trade-offs between inflation and growth are easier to manage when money is flowing into a country’s currency/debt and more difficult to manage when it’s flowing out. That’s because if there is more demand for the currency/debt, that will push the currency/debt prices up, which, all else being equal, will push inflation down and growth up (assuming the central bank keeps the amount of money and credit steady); when there is less demand, the reverse will happen . 这里聊了关于货币和经济的问题。当货币贬值，对于外来投资者持有当地货币的资产需要有更高的利率来弥补货币贬值带来的损失。如果损失不足以被弥补，那投资者就会卖出资产而转移到国外或者更保值的资产中，比如黄金。对于央行来说，当资金流入该国的时候，通胀和增长比较容易控制，而当资金流出，货币贬值，就会面临要么选择不提高利率，印钱来保经济和增长但承受高通胀，或者提高利率来维持通胀和抑制资金流出，但导致经济不行。 . Capital outflows tend to happen when an environment is inhospitable (e.g., because debt, economic, and/or political problems exist), and they typically weaken the currency a lot. To make matters worse, those who fund their activities in the country that has the weaker currency by borrowing the stronger currency see their debt costs soar; that drives down the weaker currency relative to the stronger one even more. For these reasons, countries with the worst debt problems, a lot of debt denominated in a foreign currency, and a high dependence on foreign capital typically have significant currency weaknesses. The currency weakness is what causes inflation when there is a depression. . 当一个国家有弱势货币，而靠发外债来维持经济，往往会因为货币的弱势在经济萧条期出现通胀。 . Which Countries/Currencies Are Most Vulnerable to Severe Inflationary Deleveragings or Hyperinflations? While inflationary depressions are possible in all countries/currencies, they are far more likely in countries that: . Don’t have a reserve currency (so there is not a global bias to hold their currency/debt as a store hold of wealth) | Have low foreign-exchange reserves (the cushion to protect against capital outflows is small) | Have a large foreign debt (so there is a vulnerability to the cost of the debt rising via increases in either interest rates or the value of the currency the debtor has to deliver, or a shortage of the availability of dollar denominated credit) | Have a large and increasing budget and/or current account deficit (causing the need to borrow or print money to fund the deficits) | Have negative real interest rates (i.e., interest rates that are significantly less than inflation rates), therefore inadequately compensating lenders for holding the currency/debt | Have a history of high inflation and negative total returns in the currency (increasing lack of trust in the value of the currency/debt) | . 最近看了翟东升关于货币的一些理论，感觉中国确实应该要减持美国国债，不需要那么多的外汇储备。人民币也可以乘着这波印美元发展为更强势的货币。 .",

            "content": "Think of it this way: There are only goods and services. Financial assets are claims on them. In other words, holders of investments/assets (i.e., capitalists-investors) believe that they can convert their holdings into purchasing power to get goods and services. At the same time, workers expect to be able to exchange a unit’s worth of their contribution to the production of goods and services into buying power for goods and services. But since debt/money/ currency have no intrinsic value, the claims on them are greater than the value of what they are supposed to be able to buy, so they have to be devalued or restructured. In other words, when there are too many debt liabilities/ assets, they either have to be reduced via debt restructurings or monetized. Policy makers tend to use monetization at this stage primarily because it is stimulative rather than contractionary. But monetization simply swaps one IOU (debt) for another (newly printed money). The situation is analogous to a Ponzi scheme. Since there aren’t enough goods and services likely to be produced to back up all the IOUs, there’s a worry that people may not be willing to work in return for IOUs forever. . 当金融资产不能被足够的实体资产支撑，那人们就不愿意为了一个虚无的承诺: 金融资产可以兑换成good and service而工作。美国现在就处于这种情况。美联储印钱，股市欣欣向荣，但实体经济不行，失业率一直降不下来，通胀上升，形成滞涨。当降低利率，QE都不管用的时候，就要用到Monetary policy 3. . Low interest rates together with low premiums on risky assets pose a structural challenge for monetary policy. With Monetary Policy 1 (interest rates) and Monetary Policy 2 (QE) at their limits, the central bank has very little ability to provide stimulus through these two channels—i.e., monetary policy has little “gas in the tank.” This typically happens in the later years of the long-term debt cycle (e.g., 1937-38 and now in the US), which can lead to “pushing on a string.” When this happens, policy makers need to look beyond QE to the new forms of monetary and fiscal policy characterized by Monetary Policy 3 . 感觉现在的美国就是在同一历史时期。 . Monetary Policy 3 Monetary Policy 3 puts money more directly into the hands of spenders instead of investors/savers and incentivizes them to spend it. Because wealthy people have fewer incentives to spend the incremental money and credit they get than less wealthy people, when the wealth gap is large and the economy is weak, directing spending opportunities at less wealthy people is more productive. Logic and history show us that there is a continuum of actions to stimulate spending that have varying degrees of control to them. At one end are coordinated fiscal and monetary actions, in which fiscal policy makers provide stimulus directly through government spending or indirectly by providing incentives for nongovernment entities to spend. At the other end, the central bank can provide “helicopter money” by sending cash directly to citizens without coordination with fiscal policy makers. Typically, though not always, there is a coordination of monetary policy and fiscal policy in a way that creates incentives for people to spend on goods and services. Central banks can also exert influence through macroprudential policies that help to shape things in ways that are similar to how fiscal policies might. For simplicity, I have organized that continuum and provided references to specific priorcases of each below. . An increase in debt-financed fiscal spending. Sometimes this is paired with QE that buys most of the new issuance (e.g., in Japan in the 1930s, US during World War II, US and UK in the 2000s). | Increase in debt-financed fiscal spending, where the Treasury isn’t on the hook for the debt, because: The central bank can print money to cover debt payments (e.g., Germany in the 1930s). The central bank can lend to entities other than the government that will use it for stimulus projects(e.g., lending to development banks in China in 2008). | Not bothering to go through issuing debt, and instead giving newly printed money directly to the government to spend. | Printing money and doing direct cash transfers to households (i.e., “helicopter money”). | Big debt write-down accompanied by big money creation | . policy 3就是直接把钱塞到实体经济手中，鼓励消费，鼓励创造就业，刺激实体经济。这儿财政政策和货币政策往往会配合。 .",

            "content": "Monetary Policy 1 Interest-rate driven monetary policy (which I’ll call Monetary Policy 1) is the most effective because it has the broadest impact on the economy. When central banks reduce interest rates, they stimulate the economy by a) producing a positive wealth effect (because the lower interest rate raises the present value of most investments); b) making it easier to buy items on credit (because the monthly payments decline), raising demand—especially for interest-rate-sensitive items like durable goods and housing; and c) reducing debt-service burdens (which improves cash flows and spending). MP1 is typically the first approach to a debt crisis, but when short-term interest rates hit around 0 percent, it no longer works effectively, so central banks must go to the second type. . 美联储货币政策1，调整利率来影响经济。降低利率刺激经济投资消费，升高利率抑制经济。往往是最常用的手段。但将利率下降到0之后就会失效。 . Monetary Policy 2 “Quantitative easing” (QE) as it is now called (i.e., “printing money” and buying financial assets, typically debt assets), is Monetary Policy 2. It works by affecting the behavior of investors/savers as opposed to borrowers/ spenders, because it is driven by purchases of financial assets, typically debt assets that impact investors/savers the most. When the central bank buys a bond, it gives investors/savers cash, which they typically use to buy another financial asset that they think is more attractive. What they do with that money and credit makes all the difference in the world. When they invest in the sort of assets that finance spending, that stimulates the economy. When they invest in those that don’t (such as financial assets), there must be very large market gains before any money trickles down into spending—and that spending comes more from those who have enjoyed the market gains than from those who haven’t. In other words, QE certainly benefits investors/savers (i.e., those who own financial assets) much more than people who don’t, thus widening the wealth gap. . QE量化宽松，简称印钱。用于购买政府债券以及金融资产。会主要影响投资者和储蓄者，央行给市场提供的资金，各个投资主体会选择另外的资产进行投资，如果被投资的资产是直接影响或者用于消费的那就会刺激经济，否则就比较难以通过消费直接流入实体的经济。这个货币政策是利好于拥有金融资产的主体的，因此会加剧贫富分化。 . While MP2 is generally less effective than interest-rate changes, it is most effective when risk and liquidity premiums are large, because it causes those premiums to fall. When risk premiums are large, and money is added to the system, actual risks are reduced at the same time that there is more money seeking returns, which triggers purchases of riskier assets that are offering higher expected returns, driving their prices up and producing a positive wealth effect. But over time, the use of QE to stimulate the economy declines in effectiveness because risk premiums are pushed down and asset prices are pushed up to levels beyond which they are difficult to push further, and the wealth effect diminishes. In other words, at higher prices and lower expected returns, the compensation for taking risk becomes too small to get investors to bid prices up, which would drive prospective returns down further. In fact, the reward-to-risk ratio could make those who are long a lot of assets view that terribly returning asset called cash as more appealing. As a result, QE becomes less and less effective. If they provide QE and private credit growth doesn’t pick up, policy makers feel like they are pushing on a string. . 主要提到了QE的问题，很多钱涌入市场是需要寻找收益的，会推高资产价格，当价格过高而收益降低，投资者就没有足够的意愿去承受高风险带来的低收益，而更愿意持有现金，QE就会降低效果。 .",

            "content": "There are two main ways in which failed lenders’ assets or existing lenders’ bad assets are managed: They are either a) transferred to a separate entity (an AMC) to manage the restructuring and asset disposal (about 40 percent of the cases studied) or b) they remain on the balance sheet of the original lending institution to manage (about 60 percent of cases). And there are several main levers for disposing of the nonperforming loans: a) restruc turing (e.g., working out the loans through extended terms), b) debt-for-equity swaps and asset seizures, c) direct sales of the loans or assets to third parties, and d) securitizations. . 这儿介绍了对于lender来说集中处理债务危机的方式。 . For systemically important borrowers or strategically important ones, policy makers generally take steps to ensure that the businesses remain intact as entities. In general this occurs through a restructuring of the debts to make the ongoing debt service manageable. This can occur through debt-for-equity swaps, through reducing the existing debts, lowering interest rates, or terming out the borrowing. Occasionally policy makers also introduce new lending programs to these borrowers to ensure their ongoing liquidity. This process is often explicitly one of the goals of AMCs set up to manage bad debts . 对于系统性或者策略性上重要的借款人来说，policy maker也会在必要的时候帮助处理一些债务的问题。 . As shown below, both inequality and populism are on the rise in the US today, much as they were in the 1930s. In both cases, the net worth of the top 0.1 percent of the population equaled approximately that of the bottom 90 percent combined. Typically, increased taxation takes the form of greater income, property, and consumption taxes because these forms of taxation are the most effective at raising revenues. Wealth and inheritance taxes are sometimes also increased, though these typically raise very little money because so much wealth is illiquid that it is practically, difficult to collect on, and forcing the taxpayer to sell liquid assets to make their tax payments undermines capital formation. Regardless, transfers rarely occur in amounts that contribute meaningfully to the deleveraging (unless there are “revolutions” and huge amounts of property are nationalized). . . 最近美国对收入税的调整，以及打算对富人征税都是反映了以上的观点 .",

As a result of the yield curve being flat or inverted (i.e., long-term interest rates are at their lowest relative to short-term interest rates), people are incentivized to move to cash just before the bubble pops, slowing credit growth and causing the previously described dynamic. Unemployment is normally at cyclical lows and inflation rates are rising. The increase in short-term interest rates makes holding cash more attractive, and it raises the interest rate used to discount the future cash flows of assets, weakening riskier asset prices and slowing lending. It also makes items bought on credit de facto more expensive, slowing demand. Short rates typically peak just a few months before the top in the stock market. . . yeild curve 倒挂，短期利率达峰是会在股市到顶点的几个月前。 . With investors unwilling to continue lending and borrowers scrambling to find cash to cover their debt payments, liquidity—i.e., the ability to sell investments for money—becomes a major concern. As an illustration, when you own a $100,000 debt instrument, you presume that you will be able to exchange it for $100,000 in cash and, in turn, exchange the cash for $100,000 worth of goods and services. However since the ratio of financial assets to money is high, when a large number of people rush to convert their financial assets into money and buy goods and services in bad times, the central bank either has to provide the liquidity that’s needed by printing more money or allow a lot of defaults. As this implies, a big part of the deleveraging process is people discovering that much of what they thought of as their wealth was merely people’s promises to give them money. Now that those promises aren’t being kept, that wealth no longer exists. . 解释了萧条期为什么要印钱（inflationary）或者债务违约（deflationary）。人们觉得拥有的债券或者股权，在萧条期无法换成钱（来换成商品或者服务），因为市场上流动性不足，人们觉得是自己的钱，其实只不过是别人的承诺，是完全有可能违约的。 . Since borrowers’ creditworthiness is judged by both a) the values of their assets/collaterals in relation to their debts (i.e., their net worth) and b) the sizes of their incomes relative to the sizes of their debt-service payments, and since both their net worth and their income fall faster than their debts, borrowers become less creditworthy and lenders more reluctant to lend. Even as debts are written down, debt burdens rise as spending and incomes fall. Debt levels also rise relative to net worth, as shown in the chart below. As debt-to-income and debt-to-net-worth ratios go up and the availability of credit goes down, naturally the credit contraction becomes self-reinforcing on the downside. . . 即使一些债务重组或者违约了，还是不能让借款者借到钱，因为债务负担减少的速度比收入和资产减少的速度要慢。 .",

This is especially true when inflation and growth are both good and investment returns are great. Such periods are typically interpreted to be a productivity boom that reinforces investor optimism as they leverage up to buy investment assets. In such cases, central banks, focusing on inflation and growth, are often reluctant to adequately tighten money. This is what happened in Japan in the late 1980s, and in much of the world in the late 1920s and mid-2000s. This is one of the biggest problems with most central bank policies—i.e., because central bankers target either inflation or inflation and growth and don’t target the management of bubbles, the debt growth that they enable can go to finance the creation of bubbles if inflation and real growth don’t appear to be too strong. In my opinion it’s very important for central banks to target debt growth with an eye toward keeping it at a sustainable level — i.e., at a level where the growth in income is likely to be large enough to service the debts regardless of what credit is used to buy. Central bankers sometimes say that it is too hard to spot bubbles and that it’s not their role to assess and control them—that it is their job to control inflation and growth. But what they control is money and credit, and when that money and credit goes into debts that can’t be paid back, that has huge implications for growth and inflation down the road. The greatest depressions occur when bubbles burst, and if the central banks that are producing the debts that are inflating them won’t control them, then who will? The economic pain of allowing a large bubble to inflate and then burst is so high that it is imprudent for policy makers to ignore them, and I hope their perspective will change. . 大部分央行的目标是控制通胀或者通胀就增长。但没有明确说要控制债务水平。Ray觉得既然央行是money和credit的创造者，那自然就有义务控制债务水平，太高的债务水平导致不能偿还会有很大的可能性影响增长和通胀。 . To identify a big debt crisis before it occurs, I look at all the big markets and see which, if any, are in bubbles. Then I look at what’s connected to them that would be affected when they pop. While I won’t go into exactly how it works here, the most defining characteristics of bubbles that can be measured are: 1) Prices are high relative to traditional measures 2) Prices are discounting future rapid price appreciation from these high levels 3) There is broad bullish sentiment 4) Purchases are being financed by high leverage 5) Buyers have made exceptionally extended forward purchases (e.g., built inventory, contracted for supplies, etc.) to speculate or to protect themselves against future price gains 6) New buyers (i.e., those who weren’t previously in the market) have entered the market 7) Stimulative monetary policy threatens to inflate the bubble even more (and tight policy to cause its popping) . . 这里Ray给了一个定性的表格，从7个维度衡量泡沫，估计桥水内部会有一个更精确的模型吧。 .",

Classically, a lot of short-term debt cycles (i.e., business cycles) add up to a long-term debt cycle, because each short-term cyclical high and each short-term cyclical low is higher in its debt-to-income ratio than the one before it, until the interest rate reductions that helped fuel the expansion in debt can no longer continue. In the short-term debt cycle, spending is constrained only by the willingness of lenders and borrowers to provide and receive credit. When credit is easily available, there’s an economic expansion. When credit isn’t easily avail able, there’s a recession. The availability of credit is controlled primarily by the central bank. The central bank is generally able to bring the economy out of a recession by easing rates to stimulate the cycle anew. But over time, each bottom and top of the cycle finishes with more economic activity than the previous cycle, and with more debt. Why? Because people push it—they have an inclination to borrow and spend more instead of paying back debt. It’s human nature. As a result, over long periods of time, debts rise faster than incomes. This creates the long-term debt cycle . 短期的债务周期组成了长期债务周期。每一个短期的低点一般都高于上一短期的低点，当利率降到接近0，就无法继续刺激增加信贷。 . You will note how the interest payments remain flat or go down even when the debt goes up, so that the rise in debt service costs is not as great as the rise in debt. That is because the central bank (in this case, the Federal Reserve) lowers interest rates to keep the debt-financed expansion going until they can’t do it any more (because the interest rate hits 0 percent). When that happens, deleveraging begins. . 借债越来越多，但利率越来越低，所以还款并没有增加多少，但当利率不能再降，也就也就意味着还款压力就上来了，这个时候就要开始去杠杆了。 .

It is from a desire to help reduce these risks that I have written this study. . 债务本身的问题不是最大的，而是决策者是否有认识和能力去做出正确的措施，以及这样做的政治后果给决策者带来的顾虑（比如给富人加税导致失去政权）。 . I want to reiterate that 1) when debts are denominated in foreign currencies rather than one’s own currency, it is much harder for a country’s policy makers to do the sorts of things that spread out the debt problems, and 2) the fact that debt crises can be well-managed does not mean that they are not extremely costly to some people. The key to handling debt crises well lies in policy makers’ knowing how to use their levers well and having the authority that they need to do so, knowing at what rate per year the burdens will have to be spread out, and who will benefit and who will suffer and in what degree, so that the political and other consequences are acceptable. . 承接上面，有认识，有能力，并清楚知道不同方案各个方面的影响是否可以接受是处理债务危机的关键。 . There are four types of levers that policy makers can pull to bring debt and debt service levels down relative to the income and cash flow levels that are required to service them: 1) Austerity (i.e., spending less) 2) Debt defaults/restructurings 3) The central bank “printing money” and making purchases (or providing guarantees) 4) Transfers of money and credit from those who have more than they need to those who have less Each one of their levers has different impacts on the economy. Some are inflationary and stimulate growth (e.g., “printing money”), while others are deflationary and help reduce debt burdens (e.g., austerity and defaults). The key to creating a “beautiful deleveraging” (a reduction in debt/income ratios accompanied by acceptable inflation and growth rates, which I explain later) lies in striking the right balance between them. In this happy scenario, debt-to-income ratios decline at the same time that economic activity and financial asset prices improve, gradually bringing the nominal growth rate of incomes back above the nominal interest rate. . 减少支出，债务违约和重组，央行印钱，劫富济贫（富人加税）是四种手段。有些手段是通胀的，有些事通缩的，怎样完美地去杠杆（债务收入比减少的同时通胀可控并且经济复苏）是需要平衡这几种收端的。 .",

            "content": "Credit is the giving of buying power. This buying power is granted in exchange for a promise to pay it back, which is debt. Clearly, giving the ability to make purchases by providing credit is, in and of itself, a good thing, and not providing the power to buy and do good things can be a bad thing. For example, if there is very little credit provided for development, then there is very little development, which is a bad thing. The problem with debt arises when there is an inability to pay it back. Said differently, the question of whether rapid credit/debt growth is a good or bad thing hinges on what that credit produces and how the debt is repaid (i.e., how the debt is serviced) . Generally speaking, because credit creates both spending power and debt, whether or not more credit is desirable depends on whether the borrowed money is used productively enough to generate sufficient income to service the debt. . 如何使用信贷，有没有直接或者间接的产生高于贷款利率的价值（产品或者服务）是判断一个credit/debt好坏的标准。 . I strongly preferred saving to borrowing, because I felt that the upsides of debt weren’t worth its downsides, which is a perspective I presume I got from my dad. I identify with people who believe that taking on a little debt is better than taking on a lot. But over time I learned that that’s not necessarily true, especially for society as a whole (as distinct from individuals), because those who make policy for society have controls that individuals don’t. From my experiences and my research, I have learned that too little credit/debt growth can create as bad or worse economic problems as having too much, with the costs coming in the form of foregone opportunities. . Ray的态度是个人层面他更倾向于存钱以及不要借太多钱。而国家层面是不同的，因为不借钱而错过的机会成本比借太多导致问题的成本要大。 . To give you an idea of what that might mean for an economy as a whole, really bad debt losses have been when roughly 40 percent of a loan’s value couldn’t be paid back. Those bad loans amount to about 20 percent of all the outstanding loans, so the losses are equal to about 8 percent of total debt. That total debt, in turn, is equal to about 200 percent of income (e.g., GDP), so the shortfall is roughly equal to 16 percent of GDP. If that cost is “socialized” (i.e., borne by the society as a whole via fiscal and/or monetary policies) and spread over 15 years, it would amount to about 1 percent per year, which is tolerable. Of course, if not spread out, the costs would be intolerable. For that reason, I am asserting that the downside risks of having a significant amount of debt depends a lot on the willingness and the ability of policy makers to spread out the losses arising from bad debts. I have seen this in all the cases I have lived through and studied. Whether policy makers can do this depends on two factors: 1) whether the debt is denominated in the currency that they control and 2) whether they have influence over how creditors and debtors behave with each other. . 决策者如何处理坏债是关键。决定因素在于，这些债是本币还是外币，以及决策者对creditors和debtors的影响力。 .",

A withdrawal rate of 2% will last forever–that is, if history repeats itself.” . “In summary, the organic growth of any sector seems to concentrate around 3% real growth. This is the number I would use as a safe withdrawal rate. It’s difficult to judge whether this number will be representative of the next 50-100 years.” . 作者在最后几章里提了一些基础的财务相关的计算和原则。这里聊了一下safe withdraw rate (SWR), 作者觉得3%对于他自己来说会是非常舒服的百分比：假设退休时有100w，那每月消费就是100w x 3%/12，然后每月按CPI调整。这和我最近看的一个博客Big ERN里面的分析基本一致，当然博客里写了更多仔细的分析，并且用了historical simulation并没有用Monte Carlo，原因博客也讲了。虽然美国的情况并不能代表全世界，过去也不能预测未来，但个人觉得如果一定要我猜一个数的话，60年退休期，最终资产为0，最安全的取出率应该在3-3.5%之间。 .",

Thus, if you ever want to deal with a service company, simply ask to speak with their retention department to negotiate a better deal.” . 获客成本是沉没成本，所以作为消费者来说，应该去拿到更好地retention deal . “Voluntarily stepping out of the consumer cycle and saving enough to replace one’s job with investment income instead of working isn’t “normal.” The great majority of people do neither, and those who do one almost never do the other. Anyone not consuming as much as possible tends to do so out of external necessity and thus doesn’t have savings to invest. Anyone investing for income tends to have plenty of money and thus consumes at an average if not above average level. There are few doing both; most do neither.” . 远离消费主义和让投资收入足够财富自由，这两件事很少有人在同时做。人没钱，所以买不起东西，人有钱了就买很多东西。主动地克制自己的欲望，即使很有钱了，也不买没有必要的东西，本身就是一件需要在成为有钱人之前就培养好的习惯。 . “An ecosystem has four components, which form a cycle: Abiotic (resources), producers, consumers, and decomposers. Modern economics only considers two of these relevant: producers and consumers. It ignores the finite abiotic resources and presumes that their only limit is the producers’ ability to turn them into commodities. Similarly, consumers and producers ignore decomposition. Once our waste and detritus is dumped into landfills, lakes, rivers, and the atmosphere, and is out of sight, it is, for all intents and purposes, out of mind. Meanwhile, the finite planet is running out of its finite resources (duh!) and pollution keeps increasing and is starting to bite back. Typically, the economists solve this problem by waving their hands and mumbling something about substitution and human ingenuity. However, it’s obvious that our cultural paradigm is incomplete and that resources and decomposition capacity can no longer be considered infinite.” . 作者点出了工业化后的生产消费模型的问题所在：人们有意忽略了资源的有限性和分解能力的有限性。我们只在乎生产和消费。 .",

Don’t buy anything unless it has been on the wish list for at least 30 days. You will likely find that you have either found an alternative to buying it in the meantime, perhaps by finding an alternative or by learning how to do without it.” . 这个把东西写在wishlist里30天后再决定要不要买的方法其实挺好的，避免自己冲动购物。尤其是对自己喜爱的东西，人们总是更不能抑制自己的欲望。 . “If I have to get something new, like rollerskates, I just get last year’s model. Last year’s inventory is typically cleared at certain times of the year, so keep an eye out and be ready to pick it up; it goes fast!” . 真要买新东西的时候可以考虑去年出的“新产品”。这个非常适用于电子产品，就比如macbook pro，新款的性能大部分人都是用不到的，那就可以考虑在打折的时候买macbook air或者13寸的pro。 . “Low-intensity exercise (see the list of intensity levels in this table) doesn’t burn many calories–a pound of fat, that is 4,200kcal, will supply enough energy for a 50mile run–and it doesn’t burn any energy after the run. In fact, it may even be detrimental. Conversely, adding a pound of muscle mass increases the daily metabolic rate by 75-100kcal just to keep the muscle alive. It’s thus clear that decreasing muscle mass is self-defeating as a strategy to fat loss” . 提高新陈代谢率是减肥的有效手段之一，撸铁来增加肌肉质量，从而达到消耗更多的卡路里。 . “The optimal interval for strength and endurance is the Tabata interval, which means 20 seconds of all-out exercise followed by 10 seconds of rest and repeating this sequence throughout the entire workout; that is, working roughly 2/3 of the time. Increasing the weight and rest-to-work ratio prioritizes strength. Decreasing the weight and rest-to-work ratio prioritizes endurance. Pure endurance aims for working 100% of the time.” . 休息运动时间比1：2是一个可以参考的指标。增加重量以及增加rest-to-work ratio可以偏重于力量。反思自己最近一年健身，感觉在没有加重量的情况下，rest-to-work ratio太高了，差不多做30秒休息1.5分钟。 .",

The depreciation principle is widely understood to apply to cars, given the popularity of the used car market. Most people have an idea of the blue book value of their car–that is, how much it can be sold for used. However, everything else has a market price even if it doesn’t have an army of salesmen or corresponding blue book. Make it a point to know the market price of all your stuff. Doing so makes it a simple matter to calculate the annual depreciation cost, which is the true cost of ownership. Everything I own is for sale. In my mind, I’m only holding it temporarily. If I need something else for a while, I can always buy it on eBay or find it on Freecycle or Craig’s List. In this way, these become like giant libraries of stuff I can “rent” for a while at the cost of depreciation. With sufficient capital, the initial outlay never matters. What matters is the depreciation cost because this determines how much value can be recovered. Even though this is nominally ownership, I prefer not to think of it this way, which allows me to avoid becoming attached to my stuff.” . 这儿作者具体说了他觉得物品只是暂时拥有，成本可以按每年的成本来计算。 .",

This is hardly a worthwhile sum for 30 years of waiting. But invest $100,000 at 8% for 30 years and you get $1,000,000. That is real money. To get anywhere, it’s thus very important to quickly build a substantial foundation. Setting small goals in a situation which depends on exponential growth is a guaranteed way of not seeing results very fast. Conversely, putting in a large initial effort is a guaranteed way of seeing immediate and growing returns. The middle of the curve shows a proportional relationship between effort and results–work more and get more results; work less and get fewer results. In other words, this is the stage where extra effort is rewarded more than it was in the beginning, because it’s leveraged by the now higher production.” . “With further effort, the production ceiling starts to kick in due to limits on resources, customers, responsibilities, market size, etc. You might have found yourself with a job description that could be done in three hours a day even though you nominally have to work for eight hours. If so you know what I mean about reaching the productivity ceiling. In such a situation, it makes little sense to increase work effort by 25% if the return in productivity only increases by five percent. In such a case it is better to start additional projects, look for more responsibility, or learn something else. These projects would then each have their own curve for you to progress along.” . 这儿讲了一个sigmoid function, d(total productivity)/d(total effort)=(1-P)P。当P比较小的时候，增长的速度是比较小的。想要到达类似指数级增长，必须要有一个比较大的基础，P=1/2的时候增长率最大。这也就像是财富的积累，当你只有一点本金的时候，即使你做了最正确的投资决策，也很难快速积累。当有一定量的本金后，那财富增长才能类似指数增长。但当你的资金到达了一定规模想要长期继续这种增长又变成不可能，因为你撞到了行业、市场、资源的天花板，以及你的资本可能已经是大头了。这样你继续努力，其实增长就变得不值得，在这个时候可以选择去做别的事。 . “The optimal life strategy is to maximize total “production” for all the things you engage in or whatever the curves are measuring–presumably you’d have a curve for each project and multidimensional returns for each project, where total utility (see Building blocks) is maximized (see Ecological). Pricewise, it would be impossible to quantify because it would require you to determine the exchange rate between health, money, satisfaction, meaning, etc., some of which can’t be quantified. Those values can be subjectively determined, though (see Emotional).” . 最佳策略其实应该是根据个人的优先级去平衡人各个方面的产出，使总产出达到最大。这里比较难以科学的去衡量，所以大概是那个意思。 .",

It’s natural that employers prefer employees of the latter persuasion, as they can just break goals into smaller goals and hire an employee for each sub-goal. As an individual or a business, the focus should be on the process rather than sub-goals, lest the long-term perspective be lost.” . 过程为主，结果为反而是副产品。我觉得虽然要注重过程，但一开始的目标设定还是得要清晰的、可执行的，过程中注重体验和反馈，并及时调整目标。其实很多时候能实现的东西往往是超出或者不到我们一开始的预期的。 . “Tactics are often presented as lists. These lists are both helpful and useless at the same time. They are helpful because they allow people to pick up a thing or two that they have not seen before, but they are useless because few people are capable of memorizing hundreds of little rules that might not even apply directly to their situation and remember to obey all of them. In that sense, tips are like a collection of pretty postcards or pictures of specific instances of a particular way of living. They are interesting to look at, but they do not substitute for a map of the lifestyle, nor do they substitute for navigating the map, and most importantly, knowing them does not make anyone an expert.” . 相比于记住一些tips，鸡汤，学会如何找到一件事的“地图”和“原则”，如何用“地图”为自己导航更为重要，因为一旦找到根本性的原则，那战术在很多时候就会变得很自然。 . “Focusing on utility rather than consumer products or instructions is a key tactic. Success is then redefined from accumulating and consuming the maximum number of products or the most expensive products to deriving the maximum utility.” . 最大化的不是你积累了多少东西或者东西多贵，而是东西本身的价值比如耐用性、观赏性、对个人的独特意义等等。 .",

The taken position is a zeroth-order effect and it has first-order effects. Positive effects go over the line. Negative effects go under the line. Each effect also has second-order effects. Positive effects go over the line. Negative effects go under the line. It’s difficult to say if a position that has a weak positive first-order effect with a strong negative second-order effect or a weak negative first-order effect with a strong positive second-order effect is net positive. If this can’t be determined, the behavior is too complicated and should be avoided (see here). Hopefully this won’t be a problem and second-order effects can be ignored. However, sometimes second- and even third-order effects either add up or accumulate undetected for a long time before triggering spectacular event.” . . [Hobby] The zeroth-order goal is to have fun. The first-order negative side effect is that it costs money. Another first-order negative effect is that it may require space. This space requirement has a second-order negative side effect in that this too requires money. A first-order positive effect may be meeting new people. A second-order positive effect of that is that this could allow for professional networking. A third-order positive effect is that this could lead to a job. . [Side business] The zeroth-order goal is to learn how to run a business. Startup costs are a first-order negative effect. Income is a first-order positive effect; for many, income might be the zeroth-order goal. Running a business has a time cost which may be positive or negative. Regardless, a positive second-order effect of this is that this time is not spent spending money. . [Job] The zeroth-order goal is to earn money. Developing a career is a first-order positive side effect. Being stressed or unhealthy is a first-order negative side effect, as is the cost of business attire and keeping up appearances. A second-order negative effect of this is spending money to make up for this, either by taking drugs or shopping. . 这里提到的鱼骨图还是挺有意思的。衡量是否要去做一件事，先找到它最根本的zeroth-order effect作为鱼骨的脊椎。然后找出first-order postive和first-order negative effects，再从first-order effect出发找出second，third order effects。然后综合去衡量一件事对于一个人来说是更加积极还是消极。如果比较难判断，那作者觉得这件事就态度砸了，干脆不做。作者同时也提示，second- or third-order effects可能长期积累也会有很深刻的影响。 . 可以拿读书来举个例子。对于我来说读书： zeroth-order effect是丰富自己的内心。 . first-order postive effect: 拓宽自己的视野，从不同的视角看世界。 second-order postive effect: 能够帮助在工作生活中多角度看问题 | second-order negative effect: 如果缺少思考和选择看什么书，容易被带跑偏 | . | first-order postive effect: 发现自己的无知，以及看到世界的广阔。 second-order positive effect: 让自己养成谦逊的品质 | . | first-order negative effect: 以我的看书习惯比较费脖子，对健康有影响 second-order postive effect: 促使我经常起来活动 | . |",

In a world of scarcity, instant gratification is the optimal strategy. In a world of abundance, delayed gratification is the optimal strategy. Genetically, there’s a preference for the former, which means that a mature person with a measure of self-control has an advantage, being able to wait for bargains. It also means if you have patience and don’t depend on speed, there are fewer costs to be paid for the additional power that speed otherwise requires. It’s helpful to master the art of waiting. We are prone to action, but often the problems we perceive as urgent turn out to be less than urgent. Sometimes they will even resolve themselves without any interaction.” . 合理的等待，和延迟满足在很多时候是省钱，提高性价比的好方法。尤其是在物质丰富的时间，延迟满足的效益往往高于即刻满足。我们以为很紧急的事，比如新出一个什么产品，其实等一阵子价格自然下来了，甚至我们会想清楚也没必要买，可以有其他的替代品或者选择不种下这个因。 . “Another way to think of a heterotelic response to a problem is that it aims to fix a single symptom of, say, a disease. If the response causes undesirable side effects, additional drugs are taken in an attempt to fix these side effects. Here many arrows are used in the figure to try to get closer to the desired goal. The heterotelic response makes particular symptoms more bearable and tends to encourage more problem-causing behavior. If hiding the symptoms is effective, then Liebig’s Law of the minimum suggests that additional symptoms will appear. If these in turn are treated heterotelically, then eventually the underlying problem will become so large that the system fails catastrophically (stress -&gt; burn out -&gt; depression -&gt; heart attack) or simply becomes unsolvable. Conversely, the homeotelic response aims to fix the entire problem–that is, cure the disease. Naturally, this is the ideal approach, but it requires a wiser approach to the problem. An important part of the systems thinking approach is to continuously increase the number of different problems that the strategy aims to solve or the number of different goals that the strategy intends to meet.” . 停留于表面，不断给“系统”打补丁，最终会造成灾难性的后果。统一性的复杂解决方案去从根本上解决问题，满足多方需求是需要不断去思考和实现的。 .",

Resilience is the foundation of most behaviors observed in nature. After all, if they weren’t resilient, they would be extinct. While not completely equivalent, consilience shares a lot with typical businesses strategies which can be transferred to the individual sphere. ” . . 关于consilience这个词，一直没太搞明白它具体的含义： . the linking together of principles from different disciplines especially when forming a comprehensive theory . 它是指不同原则之间形成联系比如一种完备的理论。在书里其实作者想要表达的是，做为一个人，如果技能点点地集中，那意味着你只能完成特定地某一类工作，就会类似流水线的工人一般，对于你的总产出会比较好预测，因为不涉及到复杂的多技能、部门协同，比如领固定工资的人和打多份工的人。与之相对的，是需要编织一个全面的技能网，去实现复杂目标的人。 . resilence这个词就比较好理解，就是弹性、抗风险能力的意思。对于一个复杂系统，如果它的多样性不够，或者子系统耦合程度太高（部分的瘫痪会导致全局性的瘫痪），或者安全边际与反馈太少，那么系统就不够有弹性。对应到人身上，比如一个家庭如果只有一个人工作来支持一家人的生活，那大多数情况下这样的模式抗风险能力就比较低，单点失败会导致整个家庭生活有巨大影响，比如个人的技能，如果一项技能水平非常差，导致成为明显的红灯，那也是需要考虑把短板补足到至少不拖后腿的程度（或者短期内找到弥补短板的人或者方法，但长期还是补足自己的能力为好）。 .",

            "content": "最近开始关注李沐大神的B站，李沐大神是机器学期、深度学习届的大牛，MXNET的主要作者和维护者之一，在分布式机器学习领域有很重要的贡献，现在任职于AWS做Senior Principal Scientist (应该是L8等级，如果硬要对标国内的话估计在阿里的P10,P11等级）。在翻看大神视频的间隙，看到了一篇大神的工作五年反思以及另一篇用随机梯度下降来优化人生，深受触动。因此，也想借此机会写一篇工作五年总结（08/2016 to 10/2021）来做一次五年反思。 . 做有价值的事 . 对自己的价值 . 做一件事对个人的价值可以是提升自身的能力和思维，获得即时的反馈或者是延迟的反馈。就拿一块石头最比喻，做对自己本身有价值的事就像是延拓石头空间的边界（例如进入新的领域），可以是打磨石头本身（例如在一个领域深耕），还可以是改变石头本身材质比如从沙子压缩成了钻石（提升核心能力和思维层级）。投资自己，做对自己有价值的事，是所有事的基石。这让我想起了Ray Dalio在他很有名的视频How the economic machine works最后的建议中提到的 . Rule one: Don’t have debt rise faster than income. Because your debt durdens will eventually crush you. 量力而行。 | Rule two: Don’t have income rise fast than productivity. Because you will eventually become uncompetitive. 德要配位。 | Rule three: Do all that you can to raise your productivity. Because, in the long run, that’s what matters most. 投资自己是长期最终要的事 | . . 对核心圈的价值 . 这儿我想把自己身边能够直接影响到的人(核心圈)和更广泛的“社会”区分开来。核心圈可以包括身边的人比如夫妻，子女，直属亲人如父母，直接工作伙伴如直属上级下级、直接同事，亲密的朋友。根据李沐大神一件事的价值公式 . 受益人数 x 人均时间 x 单位时间价值差 . 因为核心圈的人数本身不容易增加，也不应该轻易增加，因此重心应该是放在提升人均时间和提高单位时间价值上。比如李沐大神提到了，陪他的儿子，虽然会对工作时间、质量等方面造成影响，但这件事提供了大量陪孩子的时间以及世界上独一无二的价值：一个父亲和子女的互动的单位价值远远高于与一个平均的人互动的价值，以及它是不可替代的，并会有非常对孩子和父亲都有非常深远的影响。 . 对核心圈以外的价值 . 对于核心圈以外的价值其实有点类似于，把你自己这一块石头投入社会这个大的海洋中，泛起的涟漪就是你的影响。大部分人只是小石头，影响非常有限，少部分人是更大、更重的石头，有些甚至能到达陨石级别，它们所激发的能量能够影响成千上万人，甚至跨越时间地影响后世。在这个层面，要做的有价值的事，可能是做一个受众很广的产品。这个产品可以是物质的比如袁孔平老先生的杂交水稻，也可以是精神的比如乔布斯的斯坦福演讲。这一切的前提在于你本身的能量，传播路径和受众的理解度，只有当两者兼备的时候给社会带来的更多价值。假设一个人或产品本身没有实打实的能量，那即便受众很大，带来的实质影响从深度和广度来说也是有限和片面的，就有点像你把一大把沙子均匀的洒进大海，和一个同质量的陨石带来的影响，是完全不同的。同时，如果你没有很好地关心传播途径和受众本身的接受度，那即使你的能量很大，那对受众的影响也是有折扣的。 . 现在的社会把传播路径已经做得非常好了，这并不是说我们就不需要投入精力在这上面，而是不能仅仅把资源和精力放在路径上。打铁还需自身硬，同时想清楚自己想要影响什么样的人群，怎么样更好地使他们理解等等。现在太多的人在“肚子空空”的情况下火了，这也许能够带来短暂的流量、金钱、地位，但对于个人长期来说并没有益处。 . 目标的选择 . 就像李沐大神在用随机梯度下降来优化人生里提到的，目标要大，如果你很轻易地知道你要走到哪里，通过大概什么样的途径，那可能目标就不够大。很多人会说“这是对大神来说，我一个普通人不需要什么足够大的目标”。这中理解反映了几个问题： . 并没有用成长的心态去看待自己，觉得自己的才能是恒定的，并不能有巨大的成长。自知之明的意思并不是限制一个人的发展，而是认清楚自己目前所在的位置，一步一步去走向目标 | 目标足够大都是因人而异的。你的大目标可能别人的小目标，但这并不代表你的目标就不足够亦可赛艇，也不代表不需要你付出足够多的努力。不要被别人玩的游戏影响了自己的人生 对于生长在和平年代的我来说，财务自由是下一个阶段要实现的目标，做到资产带来的被动收入足够支付的支出。当不再为一辈子的生计发愁时，目标应该会是影响更多的人，给别人带来帮助和价值，而至于是什么价值，这会是一个不断变化的答案。而现在的我还是像李沐大神所说的，把时间专注在未来3年的目标上会比较好，在此期间，其实也有很多机会实现为核心圈提供价值和为社会提供价值的机会。 | . 对工作五年的反思 . 最近写过一篇在WhatsApp的这三年反思了近三年的工作，在18年跳槽的阶段写了选择FB跳槽总结以及Oracle Internet of Things Cloud，也多多少少的每年年末写了一些年度的反思。现在回头来看，从刚来美国读了一年master就毕业的出入职场的小白，到今天有幸在组里承担TL的工作，5年间的收获颇丰。工作5年来最大的收获，其实并不是做的项目，也不是升了职，而是是工作生活中培养的习惯：终生学习，深入思考和勇于尝试。 . 终生学习 . 这个在WhatsApp的反思中也有所提到，从19年底培养了阅读的习惯，进而拓展到了终生学习。就像苏格拉底在《申辩篇》里提到的，真正有智慧的人是会觉得自己其实没有什么智慧，自己的所知就像一滴水相较于大海一般的渺小。终生学习是唯一能够了解自己的无知的唯一途径，也正是通过阅读各种学习书籍、博客、文章，看各种教程，我越发清晰了自己的短期和长期目标。 还有一点对于终生学习的思考是关于广度和深度的问题。在Early Retirement Extremely一书里提到了文艺复兴人的概念，也就是会很多领域的技能。 . A Renaissance man is a person who is competent in a wide range of fields, covering intellectual areas as well as the arts, physical fitness, and social accomplishments. This contrasts with the more modern, specialized approach, where a person is encouraged to build skills in a single vocation and use the income from that to pay for everything else. . 个人认为广度是必要的，但并不是说浅尝辄止，而是一项技能或者对一个领域的理解至少到达到可以工作的水平（working proficiency）。举个栗子，如果想要学剪头，那收益至少要达到剪完头的人能够正常的走出去。至于深度，我觉得可以现在一个领域到达专家的水平，在这个过程中我们往往培养了不仅仅是知识的积淀，还有习惯的培养比如如何深挖一个领域，遇到问题如何解决等等。当再一个领域到达专家水准后，很多技能和习惯是可以迁移到相近领域的。 . 深入思考 . 仅仅是照单全收的学习肯定是不行的。有很多优秀的书籍并不是工具书，需要一个人能够想象自己就是作者，去理解表象背后的逻辑，才能真正运用在自己所面对的问题中。最近李沐大神的“带你读论文”系列的视频也提到了相关的内容，比如要站在当年的背景去想如果是自己在论文作者的位置上会做出什么样的选择，以及从现在的观点反观当年的选择，思考可不可以做出更好地选择。总结来说就是需要有pre-morterm的思维和post-mortem的思维去思考一件事。 . 《Deep work》和《The One Thing》的书中都提到了留出足够的大块时间给最高优先级的事，但现代社会有太多东西可以使我们的时间碎片化。在工作中邮件、通知、聊天、会议、各种各样的工作事项，都可以轻易侵吞整块的时间，每天感觉做了很多事，但又感觉做的事都是一些杂事，没有很系统的思考优先级。我觉得无论一个人在什么等级，都需要留出足够的时间不受打扰地思考优先级，哪怕这可能让你不能兼顾到所有事项（而导致一些事的延迟甚至失败）。我们不能用战术上的成功来掩饰战略上的失败，捡了芝麻丢了西瓜非常容易，有勇气花时间去思考当下、几个月内、几年内最有意义的事，并坚持去做，并及时反思和调整，是非常不容易的。在决定了优先级后，其实可以把自己是怎么思考，参考了什么而做出这个决定的过程给记录下来，在复盘的时候可以用后验的视角去反思。 . 勇于尝试 . 小步快跑，勇于试错是李沐大神在用随机梯度下降来优化人生也提到过的点。对于一个复杂目标来说，除了要有一开始的目标选择和深入思考外，勇于尝试，及时做小反馈和小调整是很重要的。尤其是尝试新的领域，在没有积累的情况下，很少能在一开始就有灵感而看见对的东西，从别人的经验中借鉴是一种方法，但最终我们还是要去自己实践和调整。看得再多，不亲身实践和体会，那也只能浮于表面。最近的工作里也是在思考未来三年组里应该要投入哪一块，能有大致的想法，但是任何宏伟的宫殿有再完善的设计还是需要有一个接一个的项目，一砖一瓦搭建起来的。很多人在一开始也都会持怀疑或者观望的态度，只有你拿出了一定的成绩和原型，别人才会愿意来继续投资。因此三年计划不能只停留在计划上，而是要有短期的成效和收益来平衡长期的投入，至少得把饼画的别人摸得到，而不是只停留在ppt上。 .",

A web does not fail catastrophically if it’s cut in a single, or even a few places. It’s resilient, whereas a plan is not. This is why having a strategy is much preferred to having a plan. . 线性的计划很容易因为其中的一环偏差、出错导致整个计划出现严重的错误。在设计的时候需要考虑策略的每一环有哪些风险，每一环和每一环之间有哪些风险，关键的节点需要有plan B甚至plan C，当计划的执行出现问题时，有没有预案止损等等。 . “A web comprises and connects a person’s thoughts, ideas, experiences, memories, goals, values, desires, connections, assets, liabilities, predictions and expectations. Here, a larger inventory of the aforementioned means there’s a greater variety of possible strategies and that any given plan becomes more flexible. Focusing solely on the coordination aspect and ignoring the tactics can result in “clueless manager syndrome.” Conversely, focusing solely on the knowledge of tactics or skills described in Human capital and necessary personal assets would only produce a person with a multitude of hobbies. Only the combination of skills and coordination will unleash the creativity of an expert. Creative synthesis occurs when you’re able to see principles as an abstract model representation and apply the abstracted model elsewhere. With experience, you’ll see that the number of such models in the world is actually quite limited.” . 既要做到掌握节点之间的协调和全局，也要熟悉节点自身的运作规律。其实要做到这个是很难的，很少有人能够同时顾全大局，同时又事无巨细的关注到细节。当项目小的时候只涉及到5-10个人，还是有可能做到的，但一旦超过10个人，就需要有一定的结构和抽象，并设置一些“警报”去帮助自己管理整个项目。 发现一件事背后的模式和规律是很重要的，而这样大的规律其实非常有限：认清楚事物和人都是螺旋上升或者螺旋下降的，合理地运用好正负反馈。 . “This means that one doesn’t need another 10,000 hours to become an expert in another field, even if it’s only marginally related. It means that it’s easier to master several different fields than is commonly assumed.” . 当成为一个领域的专家，其实很多背后的道理都是相通的，因此成为另一个领域的专家其实不需要太长时间（当然如果是完全不相关的领域可能需要的时间更久）。 .",

It’s always easier to cut away than it is to create, but it’s not always the best solution.” . 做减法不一定是最好的选项，可以考虑对问题更好地如何做抽象。做抽象能够减少概念，如何把这些把一个大的概念、系统解耦合，控制好不同部分的交互与自由度，因为一旦自由度高了，系统的复杂度就会指数增长。 . “For a creative person, workload management with external constraints is especially stressful. A manager executing simple procedures may more easily divide his day into 15-minute slots and do different things in each slot.39 A creative person and even a craftsman can’t do so, as both need time to retool. For the creative person, the retooling happens subconsciously, and when the retooling is complete, inspiration suddenly strikes. This means that it’s perfectly possible to switch between things, even rapidly, according to where the inspiration strikes. For instance, at any one time I have four to six simultaneous projects going. If I restricted myself to just one project for the sake of simplicity, or tried to switch projects on a pre-arranged schedule dictated by time management, there would be a lot of downtime when my subconscious was processing a problem while I would be sitting around doing nothing and being underutilized. Hence, not allowing yourself to do anything but focus on one specific task will actually not increase productivity for creative work. It will only increase productivity for assembly line work (see Economic degrees of freedom) or the management thereof.” . 这是一个很有趣的观点：一个管理者在处理简单任务的时候可以把时间分成小份，比如15分钟。但对于创造者来说，肯定不能每15分钟做一件事，然后切换到下一样完全不同的事，因为context switch会非常花费时间，往往在做下一件事的时候潜意识里还在处理上一件事。作者还表达了一个观点，比如我们在做某件不相干的事的时候意识中突然会闪现一些其他事的灵感，这是潜意识的作用，我们可以根据优先级的不同，either把灵感记下来并写好什么时候去处理，or马上去处理。作者个人会同时做4-6个项目，这样可以让自己的潜意识在消化问题的同时，可以做其他事，减少down time，我觉得如果是做4-6个非常高压的项目的话，非常不推荐，应该控制在2个以内，其他的2-4个应该是没有压力的项目或者优先级比较低没有很紧张的ddl，即使没做好也不会影响大局。 . “It should be clear that the more diverse and independent the parts of the system are, and the more complex the system itself is, the greater its survival rate. Conversely, a simple, specialized system with interdependent parts, like a career professional, is likely to break as soon as circumstances change” . . 由很多独立的子系统组成的复杂系统的存活率会很高，相反，子系统间如果相关度、依赖度越高，只针对某种目的存在的特殊化系统，在情况发生改变的时候越容易产生问题。上图在3中提到过，如果一个人对于单个点的知识非常丰富，那他转移专业的成本就会非常高，而如果对于多个领域都有相当的理解，那切换赛道就会信手拈来。 .",

Education is supposed to transform and build the character, mind, and body of the students. The point of an education is to learn a systematic way of improving those aspects–exercising, researching, and figuring things out to build a foundation for continued learning for the rest of one’s life, so that one may live his life to the fullest extent possible. Learning must become a habit (see Ergodicity and destiny) that is applied to all aspects of life before it can be said that a person is truly an educated person.” . 教育的终极目的是培养人的身心为终生学习做准备。 . “For instance, in the sciences, a young, technically adept person will be able to quickly crunch numbers and manipulate equations, while perhaps not quite understanding the underlying concepts of his chosen specialization, whereas a more experienced person will quickly understand the underlying concepts of even unfamiliar subject areas. In physics and mathematics, such experienced people are said to have physical intuition or mathematical maturity, respectively.” . 掌握了解大局的思维方式，即使遇到了自己不熟悉的领域，也能快速地了解大体情况。 . “Now, there are many ways of measuring experience, the most popular being tenure. However, working in the same place for five years does not imply five years of experience. If you’ve been doing exactly the same thing, day in and day out for five years, and it only took a day to learn, you have one day’s experience, five years over.” . 年限并不能代表经历。虽然我觉得重复做一件事不见得是坏事，只是不同的选择，比如寿司之神，但做事的时候投入了多少身心是重要的，会不会不断学习探索是重要的。 .

This makes people buy the next model and bury the other one in the ground. The sole goal of this seemingly pointless exercise is to work faster and grow the gross domestic product, which measures the resource churn.” . 所谓的经济，就是不断开采资源，做出大部分人们本身不需要但又被洗脑觉得一定需要的产品，年复一年地淘汰就产品产出新产品，GDP是用来衡量一个国家资源利用(浪费)的效率。这其实也让我反思，我们真的需要那么多产品和服务吗，有什么是可以完全不用的，有什么是需要的但不需要经常更换的。比如手机，我觉得买个性能最好的用个5年时没啥问题的，比如笔记本电脑，13年买的顶配macbook pro，硬件数据放在2021年也还凑活能用。可能有一个问题是，自己接受不了被主动或被动地被身边的人比下去，这是一个思维的问题，外物并不能定义你的人生，自己想通了就好。 . “We live in a world where the money necessary for our way of life comes out of a slit in the wall as long as we keep showing up for work, yet only experts understand the fiat-based money/credit system. We live in a world where food can be heated in a microwave oven at the touch of a button, yet only experts understand how this works. This goes for most of the other technology we use. All we know is that if we press this or that button, things magically happen.” . 现代人有太多的惯性，太多的抽象以至于我们不屑了解背后的原理和惯性的原因。比如人为什么要每天工作？因为要赚钱。为什么要赚钱？因为可以提高生活质量。为什么要提高生活质量？因为看到别人买了xxx，用着xxx，去了xxx旅行等等，看起来过的很好，很快乐。这儿其实没有说我们不需要工作，不需要赚钱，但深挖下去会发现我们并不明白赚多少钱算够，能够让自己和家庭未来的生活无忧，也不明白工作除了赚钱还有什么特别的意义，是否可以考虑换一份工作、行业。 .",

He merely becomes a financially irresponsible person with $1 million, and eventually the lucky money will be gone. A person becomes a millionaire by becoming the sort of person who “deserves” $1 million. . 怎么成为”百万富翁”？买彩票赢了一百万并不能让一个人成为百万富翁。是一个人的头脑有能力让他拥有一百万，他才能有机会成为并保持百万富翁。 . “Conversely, my dream was financial independence, which means that investment income safely covers expenses. Hence, I spent most of my time thinking about how I could a) lower my expenses and b) increase my investment income. Hence, I didn’t have a particular net worth in mind, nor did I think particularly hard about ways to make more money.” . 对于财富自由的定义有很多。作者的定义是投资带来的收入可以安全的支付开销，那为了实现目标，就要研究增加投资收入和减少开销。至于要赚更多的钱，其实并不是直接目标。假设一年10万可以让你过的很好（考虑通胀），那就要研究怎么样让自己的开销控制在10w以下，并怎么让投资收入能够足以长期支持每年10万（考虑通胀)的开销。 . “Combined with self-confidence, agency is the attitude that any problem can be fixed, given enough resources in the form of time, effort, and determination. This attitude rests either on a thorough knowledge of or training in what is to be done, or on the surety that such knowledge or training can be attained. This attitude is often transferable from one field to another, completely unrelated field.

Wage slaves are free to choose other products as long as they can afford it, but they’re not capable of creating alternatives to buying products, because they’re too busy working.” . 工作的奴隶：又是一个正反馈的例子，因为赚钱越多也要买贵的好的大的，为了承担这样的生活方式只能更努力地工作。 . “Unlike the salary man and the working man, the businessman doesn’t risk losing his job, though he does risk losing his business. Like an exuberant artist or scientist, he is internally driven towards finding solutions and he does not wait for employment to start working–the businessman is an entrepreneur. The risk for the businessman comes from the tight coupling between shareholders and bond holders on one side and consumers and workers on the other side, all of whom must be satisfied with the businessman in the middle, lest capital and profits vanish.” . 书里讲了四种人，salary man就是以一份为别人打工的工作为生的，working man是以多份短期工作卫生的有点类似于自由职业者，business man这里提到了是主动解决问题的，必须在股东、债权人与顾客、员工之间做平衡。 . “A Renaissance man is a person who is competent in a wide range of fields, covering intellectual areas as well as the arts, physical fitness, and social accomplishments.

Many of these expenses are eliminated by only owning what is actually used, and maintaining what is bought.” “Second, having significantly reduced expenses, invest the difference in businesses.” “Third, find something meaningful to do instead of work. If your work is really meaningful to you, you can keep working, knowing that you are living a less wasteful existence and that you have the financial security to leave your job at any time. ” . 做减法，留下真正用的东西，好好地使用和维护。投资。做有意义的事，而不是无脑的做别人让你做的工作。 . “Each reinforces the other two, but none of them rely on the others. The money saved from reducing waste can be invested, and the method leading to savings can be cast as a meaningful activity. Conversely, meaningful activities can often provide income in a way that reduces waste. In addition, savings allows one to invest in better quality–for example, paying eight times as much for something that lasts ten times longer, instead of being stuck with a low-end model that only serves to increase waste and money losses.” . 前面提到的三点是互相独立，但又互相加强。减少浪费可以增加投资，找出储蓄的活动本身也是有意义的事。而往往有意义的事可以增加收入和减少浪费。做投资也可以是买高性价比，高质量的产品从而减少浪费。 . “Coupling is a measure of a person’s dependence on the world, economic here. In principle, it also measures the world’s dependence on the individual.” “For instance, a consumer that is fully dependent on a paycheck is more likely to stay employed and not quit his job. Hence, employers can make the supply of labor more predictable by only offering full-time jobs, which makes employees unlikely to go home early, and tying in generous benefits, which makes employees unlikely to quit.” “It naturally follows that slack or loose couplings have a cost, in that they’re less efficient under normal operations. Conversely, they’re less costly under disrupted operations, such as in catastrophes. Changing the tightness or looseness of a coupling is therefore a way of adjusting risk versus profit. Here risk is defined as uncertainty rather than loss.” . 耦合是系统成功(失败)和个体成功(失败)的紧密程度。给员工提供更好的福利，延长工作时间（使人们没时间想别的），是雇主希望达到可预期留存率的手段。简单的说每个人都有自己的很多想法，那这个人就不好管理。当个体不是那么依赖整体的时候，个体的风险（不确定性）就低了，整体的不确定性反而变高，整体效率下降。 .",

However, a ladder implies that if one climbs hard enough, one eventually will get to the top. In reality, it’s more like a corporate pyramid. Not only does one have to climb hard; one also has to beat the other climbers as the pyramid gets narrower and narrower.” “Here, one solution is to moderate one’s career ambitions. After all, realizing at an early point that going all the way not only depends on skills, but also requires 100% dedication, reading time, and possibly some ethical compromises, one can aid in the sorting process by consciously seeking positions suitable to one’s more moderate aims and avoiding unnecessary competition.” . 其实现在已经感受到职场晋升并不是一个阶梯，而是金字塔。约到上层位置越少，并不是说纯粹的努力就可以做到的，机遇，想法，人脉，能力都是决定了在职场中能够达到的位置。反过来说，等级越高并不代表者他的能力越强。想清楚适合自己的位置，避免不必要的竞争。 . “the item is considered desirable simply because it’s expensive. This locks one into a spiral of “upgrading”: An expensive shirt leads to the purchase of an expensive suit; the car must match the expensive home. An increase in pay allows one to buy goods which previously seemed like a luxury. Another increase leads to another upgrade. Soon these become a normal part of life and people start identifying with them. When you identify with an object, you’re defined by the object, then controlled by it, and ultimately owned by it. If you relate to your possessions, you’re owned by your stuff, and it will make many of your decisions for you. This trap is not only mental, but also physical.” . 消费升级，生活状态的通胀，被物质所拥有。消费升级到一个程度，其实就不需要继续升级了，但通过与别人比较，企业媒体政府的宣传和洗脑，总觉得自己赚100万不能用赚10万买的东西，赚到1000万，也要考虑买1000万收入的东西。自此，不是我们拥有权利去选择物质，而是物质决定了你要继续拥有什么样的物质。 . “The result is a downward spiral of fewer skills -&gt; greater need for technology -&gt; more work -&gt; less time to practice the remaining skills -&gt; further loss of competence. The more things consumers think they need, the more control they relinquish over their lives and the more their lives are shaped by the products they own.” . 典型的正反馈，下降通道。一个人被各种用的产品所定义。 .",

The figure also shows a wider bell curve that represents the skills of the generalist. During a similar demand shift, the overlap between the new demand and the generalist’s supply is substantial. Here, a large problem is that previously acquired, specialized knowledge can’t be used as a foundation for new specialized knowledge–by definition, only generalized knowledge can serve this purpose.” “The only thing the specialist knows is how much effort it took to reach the level of the former specialization and that this must now be repeated probably several more times throughout his career.” Creating a system based on specialized production thus increases productivity, but at the cost of increased risk to and pressure on the individual. . . 知识面和技能面现代人完全比不了“古代”人。这带来了一个很严重的问题，那就是过于专业之后切换跑到的难度就非常大，尤其是跨行业。从投资的角度来说，就是all-in一个资产和多样化的区别。 .",

            "content": "“To paraphrase Einstein, you can’t solve your problems with the same mindset that created them. To live as a free person, following lists of easy, repetitive things, possibly in return for some reward, is exactly what should be avoided. Instead, it’s necessary to understand how the world works and how people have been specialized to the point of general incompetence, like ants, which only know how to do one job, but do it very well; this is not human nature. To live well, one must go beyond lists and start thinking creatively about solving problems.” . 用同样创造出问题的思维去解决问题是不可行的。比如一个人工作了很久还是觉得自己很穷，那他保持同样的工作方式，消费水平继续工作30年，也很难让他变得很富有。现在社会讲究分工来提高总体的生产效率，而忽略了人们最基本的生存技能，企图用一份工作赚的钱去支付另外的所有开销。这本身并不是一种自然的选择。 . What Gandhi said “Be the change you want to see”, may sound trite, but that doesn’t make it untrue. . 一个人怎么去影响身边的人乃至整个社会，成为一个你想要整个社会都成为的人。改变自己是我们唯一可以把握的，身教的力量远远超过言传。 . The question you need to answer is what you want to do with your life given that you don’t have the time to do everything? Do you want to spend most of your life paying off the interest of a 30-year mortgage and working so you can fill increasingly bigger houses with increasingly more stuff while being stuck in your daily communte in increasingly nicer cars? Or are you prepared to give up the stuff so that you can do whatever you want, whenever, and wherever, with reason? What will your legacy be-what you owned or who you were? . FIRE: 财富自由，提早退休。其实强调的重点在于财富自由。财富自由，并不是说你赚了大钱，而是你所拥有的财富足够长时间地支持日常的开销，而你不需要为了钱而做一些自己并不喜欢的事来换取支持生活的钱。提早退休也不代表着一般意义上60岁从一份工作中退休而不工作了，而是有自由去选择自己想做的事，从不得不做的事中退休。 . In other words, you need to believe your lifestyle as an end rather than as a means to an end. To wit, runners and other athletes sometimes get the reverse cum hoc ergo propter hoc comment that they’re already git, so they don’t need to exercise. Yet their diligent exercising is exactly what causes their fitness. How is doing good, creating wealth, establishing connections-in short, accomplishing anything-any different? . 把过程(因)作为终极目的，而不是结果最为终极目的。运动带来好的身材，并不意味着运动员就不需要运动了(因为他们已经有好身材了)，而是因为他们运动才有的好身材。 . “Barriers represent a cost which must be paid. The willingness to pay depends on a combination of dissatisfaction with the present situation, vision of the future situation, and the practicality of changing from the present situation to the future situation. This will to change can be represented by the volume of the pyramid in the figure. The volume of the pyramid represents the will to change from an unsatisfying situation to something else and depends on vision, how practical the change is, and the level of dissatisfaction with the situation.” . . Increase your dissatisfaction with present situation. | Strengthen your vision of future situation. | Build a plan to get from the present to the future. | Lower the perceived cost of the plan. | 对现状越不满，对未来的状况越有清晰的目标，对计划越有具体的规划，对计划的成本越有清晰的认识，实际做出改变的概率就越大。 .",

            "content": "这本书是2010年写的，Jacob Lund Fisker是比较早期Financial Independence Retire Early (FIRE)的倡导者。FIRE到后面也分成了LEAN FIRE, FAT FIRE等等很多种，而这本书主要是偏向于LEAN FIRE，大致就是尽可能削减生活成本，用很短的时间实现财务自由（作者用了5年）。作者在书中主要说了一种文艺复兴的人类，学习很多技能，尽可能自己做事，从各方面降低生活成本，避免消费主义陷阱，也给出了挺多实打实的计算（虽然不是重点）。书本身比较偏向于哲学而不是方法论，作者相信每个人有每个人自己的FIRE，而过多描述他自己的FIRE本身意义不大，授人以鱼不如授人以渔。 . “At some point, the teacher introduced tests and grades. Test-taking became the primary objective; learning secondary. We had the option to quickly forget what we had spent the past year learning after the test was done. In other words, we were being taught to be “flexible.” Later, there were job fairs and educational fairs telling us how to write résumés and how to interview so we could get jobs. Yet, I never learned why the world worked the way it did, and in retrospect, I think nobody ever even asked the question. Everybody always only focused on the “what” and “where;” no questions asked.” . 高度的分工，工业的生产让整个社会的效率提高了无数倍，需要的是每颗螺丝钉的专精和服从，随时可能被替换。学校训练最多也是服从，在学校服从老师，追求成绩，在社会服从老板，追求业绩，一条龙。 . “In real life, the prisoners of Plato’s Cave are those who are prisoners or slaves to their wages and their culture. A wage slave is a wage earner who is entirely dependent on their wages. While the wage slave is free to leave the current job, he isn’t free to leave the job market altogether and he can likely not imagine the possibility of doing so. He is still entirely focused on the wall.” . “A wage slave is a person who is not only economically bound by mortgages, loans, and other obligations, but also mentally bound by an inability to perceive that there are other options available, like the prisoners in Plato’s Cave. Their chains are not physical like those of 150 years ago (though they still are in some parts of the world); the chains are mental, which in some sense makes them worse, because it turns the prisoners into their own prison wardens. Like the slaves in Plato’s Cave, the only commonly accepted way for one of them to leave is to win the “prison game,” which means accumulating at least a million to retire” . 柏拉图的洞穴理论。看似的自由，比如人可以选择自己从事的工作，这本身就是被限制在了大前提，一个成人在现代社会一定要工作。在这种理论下，成功的定义就是一直工作知道积累了足够退休的财富。自我的思想的束缚比150年前物理的铁链还要有效果，毕竟人不可能做自己认知之外的事，不认为自己有除了“一直工作到退休”以外的可能性这个枷锁本身是非常可怕的。 . “Frequently, when someone is depressed, the advice is “Go out and spend some money. Buy yourself something nice. Treat yourself. Try a little retail therapy.” People don’t seem to realize that this attempt to feel good is exactly what propagates the problem. Compared to people just 50 years ago, modern wage slaves live a life of material abundance. They’re consumers” . “Similarly, many of the ways we used to do things have been redesigned to ensure that instead of doing it ourselves, we can buy some gadget or some service to have it done for us. This is convenient, because we’re usually too busy working to pay for it to do it ourselves” . 消费主义和高度分工是一个闭环。一个人只会做自己的工作，工作赚的钱来以相对的高价买其他的产品和服务，越工作，越只会一小部分事，越用钱去娱乐、缓解压力、满足各种需要，欲望也就越大，就只能越努力工作去赚赚钱。 .",

            "content": "这本书是作者采访一些“天才疯子”（主要是精神病人）的记录，每一章都是一个很有意思的小故事。 . 唯物论也好，唯心论也好，其实不冲突，大家看待事物的角度不一样。只要不用自己所掌握的去祸害别人，那就算自我认识提高了，没什么大惊小怪的。像我前面说的：你不相信并不能影响客观现实的存在 . 世界很大，容得下不同的理解。别把自己的理解强加给别人，而是分享给别人，产生一些思想的碰撞。对于自己不相信的东西，不了解的东西不要妄下结论，你不相信不代表他客观存在也不代表别人不相信。 . “我：“你没明白，死这个概念太复杂了，我用了其中一种而已。也算是自我暗示的。每天睡前，我都会告诉自己：我即将死了，但是明天会重新出生的。” 她：“明白了，真的可以那样吗？” 我：“不知道对别人是不是管用，但我很接受自己的这种暗示。每天早上，我都是新生，一切都是过去式了。虽然会有记忆，但那种状态只是一种时间旅行的状态，重点在于：旅行。就象出去旅游，心里明白总要回家的，这样思维上的死结很快就解开了，就是说跳出来了。每当面对一个新患者的时候，我总是尽可能的全身心去接受，全身心的融入，尽可能谦卑，尽可能的让对方放大自己的空间，我可以背负着全部。但是当晚，我死了，我卸下了全部。比方说情感方面卸下了，而那些观点和知识作为资料收起来，就象人体内的淋巴系统一样，病毒碎片收集起来，增加了免疫力。其实电脑杀毒软件不就是那个原理吗？我也借用了，借用在思维上。不是我多强大，而是我学会了一种状态，用精神上的仿生淋巴系统来自我保护。” 她：“……朝生暮死……” . 这是一种很奇妙的状态，每天都代表着新生，也代表着死亡，当下的正面负面的感受都打包整理化为养分。 . 问题就出来了，好人，其实代表的就是一个社会价值观。什么样的社会价值观呢？一个标准环境下的社会价值观：你要勤奋工作，才能融入社会，做社会的一份子，成为社会的一个组成个体。好好工作，孝敬父母，娶妻生子，最后安享天年。为什么要这样呢？因为社会需要这样的人，需要大量这样的人，如果都不这样，社会就不存在了，就成黑社会啦！不过，我很想知道大家真的都是这样安于现状吗？我觉得不是，但是又都没有特别聪明的脑袋，所以只好先这样过了。而且，没聪明脑袋的人是绝大多数，实际上到了这个时候，不聪明的人才是社会的真正组成者，个别有那么一点儿聪明，又不够坏的人只好安于现状，因为真正主导这个社会的，是不聪明的人。不管你怎么样，都不许出头，都按下去，老老实实按照一个模式走出来。你想出头？不可能的，你周围都是不聪明人组成的团体，怎么会让一个有点儿聪明的人发挥呢？其实这才是一个根本性的要点. . “问题就在于，有一部分很聪明的人发现了这点，但是又没别的办法，只好当坏人了，因为最快的获取方式，不是成功，而是掠夺。如果你读的世界史足够，你就会明白，欧美的强大，依靠的不是文明或者宗教，是掠夺。他们的生活方式甚至都是这样的。比方说他们治病吧，怎么治？把病毒也好，细菌也好，杀死在体内，杀不死，那个人就死了呗，他们会说：神不放开这个人。” . 原来依靠武力掠夺，现在依靠精神掠夺。人再厉害也躲不过社会国家的大背景，顺势而为是大多数人的选择。而真正的天才或者疯子，往往决定他们命运的就是成败。比如怀特兄弟如果飞机没有发明成功而摔死了，现在可能甚至没人知道他们，或者觉得是两个神经病，人怎么可能能飞呢。 . “所以杀人到底是对错的概念不是你决定的，而是你所在的群体决定的。你的群体赋予你杀人的权利了，你就可以杀。不给你杀人的权利，你杀人是要受惩罚的。因为你没有杀人牌照。” . 同样是杀人，没经过允许的杀人就成了杀人犯，经过允许的杀人（比如战争）就承认战斗英雄，但站在对立方确实“大魔头”。还是回到上面的一点，谁成功了制定了标准和规则。 .",

You can be wrong half the time and still make a fortune, because a small minority of things account for the majority of outcomes.” “It is fine to have a large chunk of poor investments and a few outstanding ones. That’s usually the best-case scenario.” . 其实人生大部分的走势也就是几个决定的事。精力总是有限的，平均投入到所有细节中只会分散了核心问题所能获得的关注。 . “Use money to gain control over your time, because not having control of your time is such a powerful and universal drag on happiness. The ability to do what you want, when you want, with who you want, for as long as you want to, pays the highest dividend that exists in finance.” . 什么是自由。自由就是不被定义，不被当成工具在别人指定的时间、地点，做指定的事，而可以在我想要的时间、地点做我想做的事。 . “Savings that aren’t earmarked for anything in particular is a hedge against life’s inevitable ability to surprise the hell out of you at the worst possible moment.” . 这是中国人习以为常的事，但在西方社会需要被特意提出来说，毕竟大家习惯了举债生活。 . “Define the cost of success and be ready to pay it. Because nothing worthwhile is free.” . 愿意为成功付出代价，尤其是别天真地以为投资的成功没有代价。 . “Room for error often looks like a conservative hedge, but if it keeps you in the game it can pay for itself many times over.” . 给自己留余地。 . “Define the game you’re playing, and make sure your actions are not being influenced by people playing a different game. . Respect the mess. Smart, informed, and reasonable people can disagree in finance, because people have vastly different goals and desires. There is no single right answer; just the answer that works for you.” . 了解自己，别被和你玩不一样游戏的人所影响自己的决定。 . “Sandy Gottesman, a billionaire investor who founded the consulting group First Manhattan, is said to ask one question when interviewing candidates for his investment team: “What do you own, and why?” . 这确实是no bs，show me your money. . “I mostly just want to wake up every day knowing my family and I can do whatever we want to do on our own terms. Every financial decision we make revolves around that goal.” . 财富自由不是为了赚更多的钱为目标，而是实现能够自由的选择过自己的生活。 . “On the rare occasion when I question our savings rate I think of the independence my parents earned from years of high savings, and I quickly come back. Independence is our top goal. A secondary benefit of maintaining a lifestyle below what you can afford is avoiding the psychological treadmill of keeping up with the Joneses. Comfortably living below what you can afford, without much desire for more, removes a tremendous amount of social pressure that many people in the modern first world subject themselves to. Nassim Taleb explained: “True success is exiting some rat race to modulate one’s activities for peace of mind.” I like that.” . 实现自由是首要目标，自己的收入水平大于自己满意的生活水平。避免社会压力与比较，rat race是永远不会有尽头的。 . “Effectively all of our net worth is a house, a checking account, and some Vanguard index funds.” “My investing strategy doesn’t rely on picking the right sector, or timing the next recession. It relies on a high savings rate, patience, and optimism that the global economy will create value over the next several decades. I spend virtually all of my investing effort thinking about those three things—especially the first two, which I can control.” . 做着自己的投资组合：20%左右的cash让自己睡个好觉，一个全款的房子，剩下的所有钱都在一些Vanguard指数基金里。非常简单。 .",

But there’s almost five trillion dollars invested in these funds.⁶” . 人们想通过投资赚钱，所以听一些电视“专家”的意见，这些专家自己也没什么可以证明投资逻辑的案例，甚至从数据上来说，满满的“失败”的案例。 . “Everyone has an incomplete view of the world. But we form a complete narrative to fill in the gaps.” “[History] cannot be interpreted without the aid of imagination and intuition. The sheer quantity of evidence is so overwhelming that selection is inevitable. Where there is selection there is art. Those who read history tend to look for what proves them right and confirms their personal opinions. They defend loyalties. They read with a purpose to affirm or to attack. They resist inconvenient truth since everyone wants to be on the side of the angels. Just as we start wars to end all wars.” “Hindsight, the ability to explain the past, gives us the illusion that the world is understandable. It gives us the illusion that the world makes sense, even when it doesn’t make sense. That’s a big deal in producing mistakes in many fields.” . 每个人都不可能完全的客观，有选择就有艺术。人们永远在尝试解释这个世界，很多的理论都是建立在一些公理上的，这些公理一旦被推翻，那所有的理论就自然不成立。这并不是说理论没有用，而是什么时候用什么样的理论很重要。 . “Wanting to believe we are in control is an emotional itch that needs to be scratched, rather than an analytical problem to be calculated and solved. The illusion of control is more persuasive than the reality of uncertainty. So we cling to stories about outcomes being in our control.” . 控制感是一种自我和解。虽然绝大部分人没有办法控制自己的命运，总是在随波逐流。 .",

It’s not complicated. It’s not guaranteed, either. It’s just the most reasonable bet for most people, most of the time. The late statistician Hans Rosling put it differently: “I am not an optimist. I am a very serious possibilist.” . 乐观主义：自己长期的行为能够让天平为自己倾斜一点。 . “Tell someone that everything will be great and they’re likely to either shrug you off or offer a skeptical eye. Tell someone they’re in danger and you have their undivided attention.” “When directly compared or weighted against each other, losses loom larger than gains. This asymmetry between the power of positive and negative expectations or experiences has an evolutionary history. Organisms that treat threats as more urgent than opportunities have a better chance to survive and reproduce.” “progress happens too slowly to notice, but setbacks happen too quickly to ignore.” “Growth is driven by compounding, which always takes time.

Pessimism reduces expectations, narrowing the gap between possible outcomes and outcomes you feel great about. . Maybe that’s why it’s so seductive. Expecting things to be bad is the best way to be pleasantly surprised when they’re not. . Which, ironically, is something to be optimistic about.” . 降低自己的预期，当结果非常好的时候就会成为惊喜。这何尝不是一种乐观的精神。 .",

If an asset has momentum—it’s been moving consistently up for a period of time—it’s not crazy for a group of short-term traders to assume it will keep moving up.

Like a car thief—though well-meaning and law-abiding—they form tricks and strategies to get the return without paying the price. They trade in and out. They attempt to sell before the next recession and buy before the next boom. Most investors with even a little experience know that volatility is real and common.

The study focused on the mid-2010 through late 2011 period, when U.S. stock markets went wild on fears of a new recession and the S&amp;P 500 declined more than 20%. This is the exact kind of environment the tactical funds are supposed to work in. It was their moment to shine. . There were, by Morningstar’s count, 112 tactical mutual funds during this period. Only nine had better risk-adjusted returns than a simple 60/40 stock-bond fund. Less than a quarter of the “tactical funds had smaller maximum drawdowns than the leave-it-alone index.

The answer is simple: The price of investing success is not immediately obvious. It’s not a price tag you can see, so when the bill comes due it doesn’t feel like a fee for getting something good. It feels like a fine for doing something wrong. And while people are generally fine with paying fees, fines are supposed to be avoided. You’re supposed to make decisions that preempt and avoid fines. Traffic fines and IRS fines mean you did something wrong and deserve to be punished. The natural response for anyone who watches their wealth decline and views that drop as a fine is to avoid future fines. ” . 人们把投资的波动性，风险当成了罚款，是需要避免的，而不是本身就需要的成本。 .",

This is true for not only savings but careers and relationships. Endurance is key.” . 复利效应其实应该有另一个角度：即使是在小的负面影响，通过不断地积累也会也有很大的英雄。“鸡毛蒜皮”“柴米油盐”的“小事”并不是简单地以加法积累的。从量变到质变会有一个turning point。 . “Sunk costs—anchoring decisions to past efforts that can’t be refunded—are a devil in a world where people change over time. They make our future selves prisoners to our past, different, selves. It’s the equivalent of a stranger making major life decisions for you. .

Think of it like this, and one of the most powerful ways to increase your savings isn’t to raise your income. It’s to raise your humility. When you define savings as the gap between your ego and your income you realize why many people with decent incomes save so little. It’s a daily struggle against instincts to extend your peacock feathers to their outermost limits and keep up with others doing the same. People with enduring personal finance success—not necessarily those with high incomes—tend to have a propensity to not give a damn what others think about them. . 越在意自己的外在，越想要满足自己无尽的炫耀的需求，那存款也就相对越少。 . “Only saving for a specific goal makes sense in a predictable world. But ours isn’t. Saving is a hedge against life’s inevitable ability to surprise the hell out of you at the worst possible moment.” . 存款是不可预知风险的对冲。 . “In a world where intelligence is hyper-competitive and many previous technical skills have become automated, competitive advantages tilt toward nuanced and soft skills—like communication, empathy, and, perhaps most of all, flexibility. If you have flexibility you can wait for good opportunities, both in your career and for your investments. You’ll have a better chance of being able to learn a new skill when it’s necessary. You’ll feel less urgency to chase competitors who can do things you can’t, and have more leeway to find your passion and your niche at your own pace. You can find a new routine, a slower pace, and think about life with a different set of assumptions. The ability to do those things when most others can’t is one of the few things that will set you apart in a world where intelligence is no longer a sustainable advantage.

Then they sat and waited for a few winners to emerge.” . 艺术品行业做的就像指数基金。 . “A lot of things in business and investing work this way. Long tails—the farthest ends of a distribution of outcomes—have tremendous influence in finance, where a small number of events can account for the majority of outcomes.” . Power law在投资中的体现，不仅是public market是这样，private market也是这样。推荐看看这篇关于天使投资回报的研究：https://www.angellist.com/blog/what-angellist-data-says-about-power-law-returns-in-venture-capital . Investment firm Correlation Ventures once crunched the numbers.²⁰ Out of more than 21,000 venture financings from 2004 to 2014: . 65% lost money. | Two and a half percent of investments made 10x–20x. | One percent made more than a 20x return. | Half a percent—about 100 companies out of 21,000—earned 50x or more. That’s where the majority of the industry’s returns come from. | . 这个数据也印证了power law . “Over the course of your lifetime as an investor the decisions that you make today or tomorrow or next week will not matter nearly as much as what you do during the small number of days—likely 1% of the time or less—when everyone else around you is going crazy.” . 在人生的所有选择中也是1%的选择起到了决定性的作用，其实就是几个瞬间的事。但平时如何武装自己去准备那些不知道什么时候需要去做的选择是人们能做的。这儿还提到了一个有意思的点，当别人都在做疯狂事情的时候，如何控制自己做符合逻辑的事，是真正的天才。 . “When we pay special attention to a role model’s successes we overlook that their gains came from a small percent of their actions. That makes our own failures, losses, and setbacks feel like we’re doing something wrong. But it’s possible we are wrong, or just sort of right, just as often as the masters are. They may have been more right when they were right, but they could have been wrong just as often as you. “It’s not whether you’re right or wrong that’s important,” George Soros once said, “but how much money you make when you’re right and how much you lose when you’re wrong.” . 当你做了正确的决定时，如何获取最大的收益也是非常关键的。这就有点像德州扑克，在关键手牌中，你拿着坚果，如何从第二坚果手中赢下最多的钱也很重要。另一个例子，如果你投的种子轮的公司有1个在A轮要被几家非常有名的VC投了，产品和利润增长都很可观，那是否使用pro rata rights追加投资就很重要了。 .",

It requires frugality and an acceptance that at least some of what you’ve made is attributable to luck, so past success can’t be relied upon to repeat indefinitely.” . 打天下和守天下需要的是两种思维模式，如何做到自由地切换真的很难。 . “Not “growth” or “brains” or “insight.” The ability to stick around for a long time, without wiping out or being forced to give up, is what makes the biggest difference. This should be the cornerstone of your strategy, whether it’s in investing or your career or a business you own.” – Michael Moritz, the billionaire head of Sequoia Capital . 现在人们会被如何成功吸引，但”成功”之后如何保持不被踢出局是非常难的。 . “Say cash earns 1% and stocks return 10% a year. That 9% gap will gnaw at you every day. But if that cash prevents you from having to sell your stocks during a bear market, the actual return you earned on that cash is not 1% a year—it could be many multiples of that, because preventing one desperate, ill-timed stock sale can do more for your lifetime returns than picking dozens of big-time winners.” . 这段话其实蛮打动我的。我们投资的时候考虑放多少现金及等价物总是考虑收益率，感觉太低了（低于通膨），所以不愿意放过多的现金。一般美国的FA都是建议放5%~10%(除了紧急备用金外)。但作者说的如果现金太少导致很多时候你需要卖出股票来应急，那其实现金的收益率就不能只算纸面上的。 . “Many bets fail not because they were wrong, but because they were mostly right in a situation that required things to be exactly right. Room for error—often called margin of safety—is one of the most underappreciated forces in finance. It comes in many forms: A frugal budget, flexible thinking, and a loose timeline—anything that lets you live happily with a range of outcomes. It’s different from being conservative. Conservative is avoiding a certain level of risk. Margin of safety is raising the odds of success at a given level of risk by increasing your chances of survival. Its magic is that the higher your margin of safety, the smaller your edge needs to be to have a favorable outcome.” . 多给自己留一些放错的空间。这就和工作有些类似，也许你觉得你加加班1周能做完一件事，但防止有任何突发情况，在做计划的时候可以先预估两周。 . “Optimism is usually defined as a belief that things will go well. But that’s incomplete. Sensible optimism is a belief that the odds are in your favor, and over time things will balance out to a good outcome even if what happens in between is filled with misery.” . 乐观主义是相信长期来说事物向好的方向发展的可能性更大，虽然中间会有很多曲折。 . “A barbelled personality—optimistic about the future, but paranoid about what will prevent you from getting to the future—is vital.” . 对未来乐观但处处小心谨慎。记得有种杠铃投资法则，90%低风险(全球化的指数基金组合)+10%超高风险(VC, PE, Angel investing, start-ups)，对于90%的组合不需要你太多的精力，无论是涨还是跌，都不需要动，让复利和时间工作，对于10%的投资组合，需要你花大量的时间，因为其实就是一种赌博，需要投入时间研究来获得insights and edges。但无论是90%还是10%，都需要多元化，小额买入很多的资产，比如天使投资人不会把所有钱就压1家公司，一般种子轮的公司都会投个30~40家甚至更多，然后追加投资给胜出者。 .",

Not that we should use past surprises as a guide to future boundaries; that we should use past surprises as an admission that we have no idea what might happen next.” . 承认极端的”黑天鹅“和异常事件、人物都是无法预测的。 . “What this means, in effect, is that all historical data going back just a few decades about how startups are financed is out of date. What we know about investment cycles and startup failure rates is not a deep base of history to learn from, because the way companies are funded today is such a new historical paradigm.” . 承接上面的观点，很多从数据中得出的经验和模式是基于过去的数据的。如果数据本身的模式就发生了变化，你还用过去的模型去预测未来，来注定是失败的。在数据科学领域有一句很著名的话: Gargage in Gargage out. . “But since economies evolve, recent history is often the best guide to the future, because it’s more likely to include important conditions that are relevant to the future.” . 这段让我想起了最近看的一个机器学习的例子，把一些久远的数据从训练集中删除，反而提高了最终模型的准确度。对于个人来说太过久远的经验可能会起到反作用，学会忘记很重要。 . “It comes from investor John Templeton’s view that “The four most dangerous words in investing are, ‘it’s different this time.’” Templeton, though, admitted that it is different at least 20% of the time. The world changes. Of course it does. And those changes are what matter most over time. Michael Batnick put it: “The twelve most dangerous words in investing are, ‘The four most dangerous words in investing are, ‘it’s different this time.’” . 这段话蛮好玩的。其实也就是表达历史是不是在重演的问题。 .",

Perhaps they go hand in hand; wanting to surpass your peers can be the fuel of hard work. But life isn’t any fun without a sense of enough. Happiness, as it’s said, is just results minus expectations.” . 最难的在于给自己设限。欲望是无穷尽的，即使是事先设限，如果没有想透彻，其实真正做到的那天也会觉得不够。Happiness, as it’s said, is just results minus expectations. 快乐就是结果减去期待值，说得真好。 . “Enough” is realizing that the opposite—an insatiable appetite for more—will push you to the point of regret.” . 什么是足够了。足够了就是”拿到更多会让你后悔，因为你得到什么必须要失去一些东西“的反面。 . “There are many things never worth risking, no matter the potential gain.” . 做人要有底线。有些东西失去了就永远拿不回来了。钱显然不是其中之一。 .",

Our prospects for much higher wages seem out of reach. We can’t afford nice vacations, new cars, health insurance, or homes in safe neighborhoods. We can’t put our kids through college without crippling debt. Much of the stuff you people who read finance books either have now, or have a good chance of getting, we don’t.

The talented employee may join a company because of its charismatic leaders, its generous benefits, and its world-class training programs, but how long that employee stays and how productive he is while he is there is determined by his relationship with his immediate supervisor. . 蛮赞同这句话的，但经理的好坏是很重要的因素之一，并不是唯一的因素，还有比如公司整体的文化，同事的水平和能力，个人的能力抱负与公司所能给予的平台的匹配程度都有关系。这儿就聊聊经理这一项，自己的感受是在Oracle做物联网云的时候在两年内有过4个经理： . 第一任经理因为相处的时间不长，而且我刚初出茅庐，所以唯一留下的印象能相信新人，并安排适当难度的任务和资源给我，让我快速上手建立信心 | 第二任经理相处的时间最长（后来成为了skip），他算是老江湖了，成为我经理的时候已经是Director等级了，所以对于技术细节已经多年不碰了，但成功的点在于新人团队的技术领袖，不会越权来看我们每天做了啥，更多的会争取资源，解决团队出现的问题比如需要延期的沟通等等。我对于他的印象是相对最多，也是最好的。有意思的是前阵子还给他内推了Facebook，说了很多好话。 | 第三任经理是第二个经理的手下，因为团队的扩大和重构，我就归到他手下了。有趣的是他是负责另一个Saas的，和我做的是sibling，但我其实还是和我原来的skip开会，原来的团队干活。第三个经历基本和我没啥沟通，除了一些签证身份的问题，基本没有交集，感觉就是挂个名负责一些我的日常（虽然也没有常规的1：1） | 第四任经理也是我skip的手下，她属于比较micromanagement，会盯着你做一些任务，会安排做一些面试之类的，但是其实也不是很懂技术，比较喜欢做项目管理之类的事。 总体来说Oracle的经理们没有给我留下很好的印象，至少我不会觉得我从他们身上学到了什么，或者给了我什么成长和支持。常规的一对一，职业发展的一些讨论，提供及时有效的反馈等等这些都是不存在的。而且本身也看不出技术的大局观，感觉基本是纯管理路线。反倒是在有限的几次和GVP接触，觉得他还是很有技术的sense，虽然可能对细节不懂，但很能点出关键点和可能的问题风险之类的，给我留下了蛮深的印象。 到了Facebook/WhatsApp后，3年一共经理3任经理： | 第一任经理接触的时间也不长，但他是整个团队的创始人，走技术流，大神级别的程序员，所有东西都是一手从0写出来的，所以在技术上有绝对的话语权。和他讨论过几次技术问题，前几次感觉不好接近，问了问题也得不到直接的回答（他的回答基本都是以他能理解的方式和我说，完全没考虑我的context）。其实这样的经理总体来说是一件坏事，虽然技术非常强，但是完全没有做经理的sense，不懂如果带团队，不懂得如果有效的激励和赋能。随着时间的推移，他逐渐发现了问题，也开始有所进步。 | 第二任经理是我刚加入的时候就确定要接手团队的，所以和他的互动是最多的。他技术也很强（和第一任是不同类型的），之前也是因为喜欢做技术，所以没有转经理路线。和他每周的一对一以及开会，总能把事情讲明白，对我技术成熟度上有很大的帮助。同时也非常愿意放手让我去做，并给我指引方向，提供很多及时的反馈。让我在短时间内有了长足的进步，还是很感谢有这样的经理的。 | 第三任，也就是现在的经理，风格和前两任也不相同。他的风格会比较坦率，比如我喜欢自己带团队做事，那他就会放手让我管技术，他只管人事，我每次对他的汇报他会仔细看，并且提出一些问题，看我是否能很好的回答，或是问我有没有什么地方需要他帮忙的，他也会对需要他比较深度介入的地方直接介入并提供有效的反馈。同时我感觉他虽然对于技术也很有热情，但成为经理后，不会直接插手技术的选型，而是旁敲侧击的提出问题，让技术领导者和团队成员去思考。他会更关注团队的文化，士气，成员的状态，团队未来的发展方向等等。 总结来说FB的经理总体素质上确实要比Oracle好很多，这和对经理的培训，很多领导团队的耳濡目染有关。经理们的第一目标是支持团队更好的工作，同时要求有技术能力(对于Software engineer manager需要IC6+才能转成经理，IC6基本等于阿里的P9)。 | .",

I would like you to put requests for me and your other investors in the email as well. Every email should have how much cash you have left, your burn rate, and when you will be out of cash so that we can all plan for future raises. . “When you do get a new report, it’s wise to read it fully and send a short follow-up with some positivity for what’s working (“nice work landing that head of sales”) while being understanding about the losses (“Sorry you lost your CTO. Is there a job description I can share on LinkedIn?”). Depending on your related experience, there are always ways for you to be helpful. I like to pose these as questions, as opposed to edicts. For example, consider these two statements: “You need to do Facebook ads.” and “Have you considered doing Facebook ads?” . Chapter 28: 跟投与救急 . When founders from strong companies raise another round, they will simply let you know that they’ve found a new investor, hopefully a venture capitalist who also wants to join the board, and tell you “what the new terms are and ask if you want to take your pro rata. You will have a date by which to respond yea or nay to reinvest or get diluted by the new money coming into the company. This doesn’t happen too often, and when it does, you should spend as much time as possible figuring out what this new investor sees in your startup. If new money is willing to pay a higher price, it probably means you picked a winner and you might want to consider putting in another $100,000. If this was a $25,000 bet, you will be quadrupling down, and if you did this as a syndicate for $1,000, you will be, ummm, maybe hundred-upling?! Centupling. . When deciding to give a bridge, you need to have a candid talk with the founders about what the bridge will accomplish, typically by having them present some goals and what the startup will look like when this new tranche of capital comes in. “What you see here is a pattern. Founders believe that one magical event is going to save the startup, be it adding a feature or a team member or a customer. You have to ask yourself two questions when presented with this strategy. First, is it true that this one event will change their trajectory? Second, is it possible to reach that event given these additional resources? . Chapter 29: 心态、策略、成长、长期的眼光 . These days, when something blows up, I tend to move pretty quickly from an initial reaction of an “Oh fuck!” to an “Oh well” and then to “Okay, now let’s focus on what’s working.” It sucks to lose, but the more time and energy you put into your losses, the more you will feel like a loser. Instead, you should have been quadrupling down on your winners and spending more time on them. . If you’re constantly learning and working hard—two things that are in your control—good things will happen. This goes equally for founders and investors, which is why my reality show catchphrase is going to be “Do the work. . You don’t need to win every pot. You don’t need to win every day. You do need to win in the long term. Think about angel investing as a decadelong pursuit. . Chapter 30: 退出方式 . When an IPO happens, your previously illiquid shares, which lived on a spreadsheet at the company, are magically transferred into your E-Trade, Charles Schwab, or—ideally—Wealthfront account (see chapter 9; I’m an advisor). These shares are typically locked up for the first six months you own them, but after that “lockup period” you can do what you want with them. . A market for selling private company shares emerged. The reasons for this are (1) the perfect storm of private companies not wanting to go public too soon and (2) the availability of massive pools of private funds from private equity and late-stage venture capital firms wanting to own significant positions in those companies. . If you have a winner and it’s surging, it’s tough to sell knowing that your equity is likely to grow. But taking 10 or 20 or 30 percent of your winnings off your table at a high-enough price and putting it back into your portfolio will almost always help you sleep better. . The third, and most common way, an angel makes their money is when a startup is bought. There are three types of M&amp;A (merger and acquisition) deals: acquihires (a.k.a. fire sales), appropriate acquisitions, and premium sales. The term “acquihire” is a combination of “acquisition” and “hire,” and it’s what you call it when a big company buys a smaller company only to hire the entire team without doing a complete end run around the investors. When a startup gets acquihired, shareholders are likely to get back just pennies for every dollar they invested. . Chapter 31: 天使投资策略 . Remember, we have more blind spots than we do clear vision, so you must unlearn what you have learned to be a successful angel. . Some angels bet on founders. Some angels want to solve a problem. Some angels bet on delight. Some angels bet on markets. . Chapter 32：和成功者同行and do the work . Soak in what you’ve learned by hitting a home run in your first thirty bets while appreciating the randomness of life. You “didn’t exactly hit the lottery, but you did get lucky because your thirty bets probably weren’t all that different from the bets of people who lost money or broke even. In fact, almost all angels probably have a very similar return profile if you take out their top investment—and the exact same return profile if you take out their top three hits. . Life is random, but luck isn’t. Lucky people surround themselves with the most successful people in the world “and take chances. It isn’t hard or impossible. It just takes work. Do the work. Trust me, just do the work. .",

Deal memo: Introduction, Deal, Competition, Hiring Plan, Key Risks, and a Recommendation. . Chapter 23: 不是不投，时候未到 . I would offer to let founders “take the red pill or blue pill” after they pitched me. In 100 percent of the cases, they took the red pill and asked me to tell them the unvarnished truth. I would then explain to them, founder to founder, exactly what I thought of their business, their product, and their pitch, plus how other investors would react to it. . These days, I am most likely to tell founders “not yet” when they ask me if I’m ready to invest. It’s an elegant phrase that Roelof Botha taught me and it works like a charm. In addition to telling them that I’m just not there yet, I let them know that I’d like for them to add me to their monthly updates. . Chapter 24: 天使投资的尽职调查 . Due diligence in early-stage investing is the voluntary act of looking into a business or individual before giving them your money. . Groupthink or perhaps even delusional thinking also tends to set in during investing, with people looking around the bargaining table at each other and thinking, “If nothing is scaring off those other three successful investors, then I’m not worried, either. I’m sure if something was wrong, one of them would have uncovered it. . During your founder meetings, you drill into a number of factual questions, getting more specific as you go. . People lie, to themselves and their investors and the world, but there is a difference between a factual lie (“We have Facebook and Google under contract!”) and a lofty mission (a.k.a. delusion) that if everything goes right, it just might turn into reality, like “We’re going to get to Mars” or “People lie, to themselves and their investors and the world, but there is a difference between a factual lie (“We have Facebook and Google under contract!”) and a lofty mission (a.k.a. delusion) that if everything goes right, it just might turn into reality, like “We’re going to get to Mars” or “We’re going to index the world’s information.” . Chapter 25: 第一次说“Yes” . You’re going to want to have a solid startup attorney review these documents for you, giving you a brief summary of the deal and calling out anything they feel is unusual. It will take an hour at most for an attorney to summarize a deal for you, and it’s well worth the cost. You should double-check that you have pro rata (see chapter 21). If it’s not in there, simply ask the founder to add it for you. They will almost universally do this without much fuss. . You should try to get a copy of the cap table if they’re willing to give it, as this gives you a very clear picture of who was involved in the round and how many shares each person owns. Over time, you’ll become good at reading these cap tables and decoding the investing strategies of other angel investors and venture capitalists. . Chapter 26: 创始人对待天使的态度 . Angels need you to crush it in order to have any chance of getting their money back and they will be your biggest cheerleaders. They love you and want you to succeed, so you shouldn’t hide from them or bend reality to what you think they want to hear. Be honest with us so we can help. . Additionally, remember that 80 or 90 percent of our investments fail, and we have to suffer through shutdown after shutdown. It’s depressing for us, especially in years two, three, and four of angel investing. . Send us monthly updates. Or twice a month. Fuck it, send a short weekly update if it’s concise—we want to help and we can’t help you if we aren’t up to speed. . First, as an angel, you need to document and fight for your rights. “Second, as the founder of a company, you should be on high alert when a new investor or an acquirer wants you to screw your earlier investors. If someone is willing to screw your early supporters, who helped you get to where you are today, what do you think they will do when your relationship hits a bump in the road? Exactly. .",

The number one reason a startup shuts down is not actually running out of money, which is what most people believe. The number one reason a startup fails is that the founder gives up. . Chapter 21: 投资已经有产品的公司与估值 . When you’re evaluating deals at the earliest stages of a startup’s life, there is not a lot of data to go on. You can put angel investing into two basic buckets: pre-traction and post-traction. . Pre-traction means the product doesn’t have users or revenue. In the pre-traction bucket, you will hear investors discuss startups in various phases of progress including, roughly from early to later: back of the napkin, basic research, business plan, mock-ups, functional prototype, MVP (minimum viable product), beta testing, and stealth mode. . Simply put, there are enough companies that have product/market fit, some traction, and some angel investors but need more capital to finish their mission. “Those are the startups you need to focus on with these first thirty angel investments. You want the people who are doing it, not the people talking about maybe doing it after you fund them. . Another great technique is to simply ask the founder, “Is that valuation set in stone?” and just listen. Perhaps they, like countless startups in the past, will come back to you in a couple of weeks, after their round didn’t materialize, and have a different number in mind. This is a marketplace and valuations can go up and down, but valuations are not as important as understanding who the other investors are, how the business is doing, who the customers are, and who’s on the team. .",

Again, never say yes in a meeting. Let them know that you need to do research and think about the deal terms. Then, only after you have seen all twenty-five, circle back and pick the best one. . Chapter 14: 你的名声是你的一切 . Founders always share investor meeting details with each other and your reputation is everything in our industry. If you are helpful, present, and considerate, then you’re going to get a great reputation. Great founders have many options to fund their companies, and your $25,000 isn’t any different from mine or another investor’s. But how a person feels coming out of an investor meeting will determine whether you’re getting in or missing out. . Chapter 15: 让对的人拿你的钱 . One hour of prep, one hour with the founders, and one hour of postmortem. Prep: product, market, competitors, other investors. . Your challenge isn’t writing the checks, it’s convincing the right founders to cash them. . Chapter 16: 与创始人的会议 . Give them your full attention (turn off your phone). Important people have the ability to turn off their phones because the world can wait for them. People who are not important have to react to their phones and be at the mercy of people pinging them. | Bring pen and paper | Never say yes of no during a pitch: This has been great. Give me a couple of days to give it some thought and let’s talk on Monday. I might have some follow-up questions on email as well. | . Chapter 17: 成功概率和选创始人 . I use two methods to sort through the deluge of startups contacting me. I eliminate the small ideas and weak founders. Then I double down on the great founders and big ideas. . Let’s think about that for a moment. If I do my job correctly, I’ll review over ten thousand startups in my decade as an angel—meeting with thousands of them in person—in order to place just two hundred bets, of which “perhaps 197, 198, or 199 will have little or no impact on my overall returns. . I don’t need to know if your idea is going to succeed, I need to know if you are. .",

            "content": "Chapter 11: 天使联合会 (Angel Syndicate) . At these sites, successful angel investors create an investment group, or syndicate, where they explain what they typically invest in, what they’ve already invested in (their track record), how much they typically invest per deal (typically $10,000 to $100,000), and how much in “carry” they will charge you on a successful exit. Carry is short for “carried interest,” and it’s defined as the share of profits that go to the fund manager—in this case called the syndicate lead. . On these platforms, the syndicate leads typically take a 15 percent carry and the platform itself takes another 5 percent, for a total of a 20 percent carry. This is exactly how venture capital firms charge their own investors, who are called limited partners (LPs), with one critical difference: fees. . With angel syndicates, you simply pay the carry. There are no fees other than some minor legal and filing fees (typically less than $10,000 per deal, spread out across the dozens of investors in a deal). Individual angels like you can sign up for a syndicate (like mine) and make a nonbinding pledge to invest a small dollar amount per deal. On my syndicate, the minimum is $1,000, but most syndicates set this number at $2,500 to weed out the more casual investors. When a syndicate lead shares a deal, each of the syndicate members gets a chance to evaluate the deal via an online profile for that startup that typically includes a pitch deck and why the syndicate lead is investing. A syndicate normally negotiates an allocation with the founder of the startup, typically $200,000 to $500,000 (or 10 to 50 percent of a seed round). If the syndicate can pull together enough investment interest, the deal is consummated. That’s why I advocate that new angels do ten small angel syndicates before they start doing direct investing. Beyond the very real chance of getting a positive return on your investment, if you do this hack, you will build your reputation, have a chance to prove your worth to founders, and jump-start your network—all for the bargain price of $25,000. That’s only 20 percent of the cost of an MBA and you can do it in a month! . Syndicates require very little paperwork and you can choose to invest without taking any meetings or doing any due diligence. The only thing you need be able to do is prove that you’re an accredited investor here in the United States and have your wire transfer clear. . Chapter 12: 天使联合会基础 . I suggest looking for these basic characteristics: . A syndicate lead who has been investing for at least five years and has at least one notable, unicorn investment | A startup that is based in Silicon Valley | A startup that has at least two founders (with two, you have a backup in case one quits) | A startup that has a product or service that is already in the market (you’re not qualified to invest in startups that haven’t released their products—and frankly you don’t need to take this risk) | A startup that has either (a) six months of continuous user growth or (b) six months of revenue | A startup that has notable investors | A startup that, post-funding, will have eighteen months of cash remaining, commonly referred to as runway (ask the founder and syndicate lead how many months of runway they will have post-funding) | . If you love taking risks and don’t mind being locked up for a decade, I could see you putting 10 to 20 percent of your bankroll into angel investing. If you can tolerate risk, but don’t love it, and you can handle being illiquid for a decade, I could see you putting 5 percent of your bankroll into angel investing. If you’re going to be a great angel investor, start at the small tables while you learn—there is no rush. Every year, billion-dollar companies are created, and that will continue for the rest of our lives . For all ten of the startups you select, you need to write a “deal memo” explaining why you’re investing, what you think the risks are, and what you think has to go right for the startup to return money on your investment. . Syndicates are your Dagobah, a place where you can learn from other angel masters without losing a limb or your head. Go ahead and ask the syndicate lead why they are investing, meet with the founders, and talk to their customers—learn how to hold a lightsaber without cutting your fingers off. .",

            "content": "Chapter 1: 技术进步无可避免 . But I don’t invest in this future because I want to sit in an ivory tower laughing at people whose jobs are replaced. I invest in this future because it’s inevitable and I think I can help accelerate the efforts of the founders and innovators who are missionaries, not mercenaries. Of course, I plan to make a great deal of money in these revolutions, but I also plan to look back proudly and know that I helped propel changes that made our planet better. . Chapter 2: 赌一赌单车变摩托 . Now, gambling has a very negative connotation here in the West, but when I would spend all night playing poker in Los Angeles, with mostly old Asian men, I would frequently hear them say “No gamble, no future,” before pushing their chips into the pot, standing up, and rubbing their necks and heads furiously (a tic I soon acquired unconsciously). . Chapter 3: 天使投资101 . Angel investing is the act of putting money into the earliest investment rounds of a private business with the goal of getting back more money than you put in—much more than you can return in a safer, more established investment vehicle. . Chapter 4: 天使的四种能力 . The best angels in the world have four qualities, giving them the ability to (1) write a check (money), (2) jam out with the founders over important issues (time), (3) provide meaningful customer and investor introductions (network), and (4) give actionable advice that saves the founders time and money—or keeps them from making mistakes (expertise). . Chapter 5: 在硅谷投资 . Yes! . Chapter 6: 网络效应 . We live in a world full of network effects. The nodes in the network here in the Bay Area are the investors (angels, incubators, and venture capitalists), founders, service providers (colleges, lawyers, headhunters, and banks), and the talent pool (developers, designers, and marketers). . Chapter 7: 投资阶段 . sweat equity: It’s not an official round of funding. It’s the original creation of the business, and, unlike an investment round, the ownership here is paid for with the founders’ own sweat. | bootstrapping: A company with sweat equity has built its product or service based on the talents of its team, but a bootstrapped company might have had some outside help—but not from investors. For example, many times the founder of a startup will find a client who is willing to pay for a product that they built with sweat equity. | Friends and Family | Self-funding: When I meet someone who is going into debt to self-fund their startup I get worried—especially if they have a family. In my mind, if you have a family to take care of and you put them at risk to pursue a startup that you can’t build with sweat equity, bootstrapping, using your friends’ and family’s money, or raising money from a professional investor, you are, in all likelihood, insane. | Incubator funding: Most incubators will give founders $25,000 to $150,000 in seed funding for 5 to 10 percent of their startup. | Seed/Angel Funding: Most founders get their seed round by successfully completing two or three of the five early-stage funding strategies above. Essentially, your job as an angel is to monitor people coming out of these channels and pick out the best ones. | Bridge Round, a.k.a. Seed Plus: This round of funding typically comes from the same investors who did the seed round. Those investors are faced with losing their investment if they don’t continue to fund the startup, so they tend to be motivated to “close the bridge. What has changed since I made my original investment? | Serias A: The Series A is the most coveted and important round for a startup because it is typically done by a professional venture capital firm that will join the board and create proper “governance. Pro rata means you get to keep your percentage ownership in a company. Typically when you angel invest, you don’t get pro rata rights—unless you demand them, and then you do. | Series B, C, D, E, F, and Mezzanine Rounds: In fact, if your angel investment is starting to raise a Series B, C, D, or further rounds of financing, it’s probably time for you to consider selling some part of your stake in what’s called a “secondary” stock sale. | . Chapter 8: 创始人&lt;&gt;天使&lt;&gt;风险投资 . Now, in today’s modern age, I think the first $5 million you make is “take the edge off” money. You now have a decade of capital to rest on. However, when you break $10 million you have “escape velocity,” where you will never have to work again. The $500,000 in yearly interest you net should cover your expenses for a lifetime. However, when you get over $20 million, you’re in the “fuck you money” zone, where you can tell anyone to go fuck themselves. It’s a dangerous test of a founder’s resolve in my experience to go from being under the gun to being able to tell anyone who stands in your way to go make you a ham sandwich. VCs really don’t like to have founders get to “escape velocity” or “fuck you money”. . For angels, secondary shares are a wise way to “dollar cost average” your returns. If you have a chance to sell 25 percent of your position once or twice before the IPO, it would be wise to do so because we’ve all seen companies worth billions go to zero many, many, many times. . Being a founder is amazing because you get to build what you want to see in the world and you’re the “god-king/queen” at your company, but the odds are wildly against founders making a huge return, while the odds are in favor of a lifelong angel or venture capitalist getting rich. . Chapter 9: 机会成本 . How to allocate your finite time and energy efficiently is something you constantly have to revisit as an investor, founder, parent, and human being. The cost of not revisiting your allocation of time is great, leading to massive regret at having spent too much time on a startup, marriage, friendship, or investment that is destined to disappoint you or destroy your soul. . Chapter 10: 让自己幸运的方法 . It’s time for you to unplug from the Matrix and realize that you don’t need to pretend you’re rich by getting the premium channel package, and actually get rich by taking intelligent risks. . Even if the investments had failed, even if people had laughed at me calling myself an angel, even though I was only investing $500 at a time, I would have learned a heck of a lot and met a ton of entrepreneurial people. You can make your own luck in this life by putting yourself next to the people who are already winning. .",

This reminds me of my recent impulse of taking over some implementation work from others in order to speed things up. Actually, I shouldn’t do that due to the following reasons: . To be an IC6, it’s expected to design and/or implement the hardest parts of the system. The implementation I took over is actually not “the hardest part” of the project. | I usurpped my colleagues role of practicing the implementation who are commited to implement the most of API level functionalities. | There is other way to speed up the project. For example, I can take time to triage the issue to tell if it’s lack of competence or commitment from them. My feeling is the latter of lacking of commitment/motivation. Then, I should talk to them formally about my expectation, project timeline and see if they were occupied by other commitments.

If you pile on too many different reasons to support your case, it can make your audiences defensive - and cause them to reject your entire argument based on its least compelling points. Instead of diluting your argument, lead with a few your strongest points. . 很多时候说话没有重点的问题是想要表达的太多，列了太多论点，反而稀释了最重要的观点。 .",

            "content": "All in all, more than a hundred studies have examined conflict types in over eight thousand teams. A meta-analysis of those studies showed that relationship conflict is generally bad for performance, but some task conflict can be beneficial: it’s been linked to higher creativity and smarter choices. . The absence of conflict is not harmony, it’s apathy. . Relationship conflict is destructive in part because it stands in way of rethinking. When a clash gets personal and emotional, we become self-tighteous preachers of our own views, spiteful prosecurtors of the other side, or single-minded politicians who dismiss opinions that don’t come from our side. Task conflict can be constructive when it brings diversity of thought, preventing us from getting trapped in overconfidence cycles. It can help up stay humble, surface doubts, and make us curious about what we might be missing. That can lead us to think again, moving us closer to the truth without damaging our relationships. . 完全追求没有矛盾，不是和谐，而是冷漠。它说明不不关心问题，不关心问题中的其他相关方。这其实是在日常工作中挺常见的，往往一个会议如果有超过10个人参加，往往参与度，讨论度都会集中在个别一些人上，其他人会因为各种原因tune out，甚至开始做自己的事。所以我觉得会议的目的是选择参与者的标准，如果一个会议是为了讨论问题，首先要考虑会议是否有必要开(比如是否可以再文档上先协作，再决定是否有必要实时地交流)，会议参与者也是只需要邀请会深度贡献在问题某一个(或几个)方面的人，邀请更多地反而会稀释讨论的深度; 如果会议是其他目的，比如汇报工作，或者传达消息，那自然有另外的流程与要求。 . 对事的矛盾可以演化为事物前进的动力，对人的矛盾往往涉及到情感的攻击而偏离矛盾的本身。团队的领导需要很明确这一点，尤其是对比较年轻不太有经验的成员，或是明显感觉到对人有攻击性的成员，需要单独说明对事不对人的原因，自己的标准。在刚工作的前两年，自己在这方面也做的不好，有时候会觉得为啥一个人那么讨厌，其实对方可能针对我完成的代码或是设计，而不是对我本人有意见。 .",

            "content": "I’ve noticed a paradox in great scientists and superforecasters: the reason they’re so comfortable being wrong is that they’re terrified of being wrong. What sets them apart is the time horizon. They’re determined to reach the correct answer in the long run, and they know that means they have to be open to stumbling, backtracking, and rerouting in the short run. . 这就像学生时代，作业的错误是为了避免小考的错误，小考的错误是为了避免期末考的错误，期末考的错误是为了避免升学考试的错误。在不同规模上”试错，犯错，反思，迭代，进步”，控制犯错的成本和时机。当然这个在一个组织中很取决于组织的文化，是否有心理上的安全感，可以让大家看到你犯的错误，通过别人的错误来反思。这个后面的分享会提到。 . Yes, we’re entitled to hold opinions inside our own heads. If we choose to express them out louad, though, I think it’s our responsibility to ground them in logic and facts, share our reasoning with others, and change our minds when better evidence emerges. . 我们都有权利拥有自己的想法。但想要表达出来的时候，要考虑自己的想法是否成熟，理由或是数据是否能支持你的想法，有没有想过对立的想法。想法谁都可以有，但受过压力测试的想法，有事实支撑和逻辑严密的想法往往才是有分享价值的。往往越有智慧的人，越不轻意分享自己的想法，哪怕这些想法在一般人看来已经可以奉为圭臬。其次一个想法本身是有时空局限性的，100年前的好想法，现在看来可能很蠢。在听到很有道理的想法时，要看它的使用范围和条件在你面对的条件下是否满足，在分享自己的想法时，要加上语境和限制条件，在新的条件出现时，进一步调整成熟的想法。 .",

The above two pokemon are quite similar to each other. From wiki) . it esolves from Mankey starting at level 28. . Let&#39;s take a look at another confusion pair:(&#39;Ponyta&#39;, &#39;Rapidash&#39;, 4) . Image.open((path/&quot;Ponyta&quot;).ls()[0]) . Image.open((path/&quot;Rapidash&quot;).ls()[0]) . It&#39;s another pair of evolution.From wiki) . It evolves from Ponyta starting at level 40 . Let&#39;s fine tune our model . First step, pick a more deeper model resnet34 and find a optimal learning rate . resnet34_learn = cnn_learner(dls, resnet34, metrics=error_rate) lr_min,lr_steep = resnet34_learn.lr_find() .

            "content": "Recently, I am taking a online deep learning course on fast.ai. The lesson 3 of the course is focusing on data ethics. The lecturer, Rachel Thomas, touches a few points that I echo back. Around 1:52:50, there is a short discussion . Q: Maybe the best way to incentivize ethical behavior it to tie financial or reputational risk to good behavior. In some ways, similar to how companies are now investing in cybersecurity because they don’t want to be the next Equifax. Can grassroots compaigns help in better ethical behaviors with regards to the use of AI? Rachel Thomas: …I think it’s hard for people to make the case to their boses of why they should be investing in cybersecurity. Particularly because cybersecurity is something that when it’s working well, you don’t notice it. … . Lots of things like cybersecurity that people are lacking of incentives/motivation to make an investment before something really bad happens to themselves. My personal experience is when designing a product (or running a service), many companies are eager to launch their product/service as early as possible with little test, and they call it “test it in production; move fast; quicker iteration beats fine-tuning”. In some cases, it will only lead to acceptable level of bad user experience while in others it could be devastating and turns out completely shutting down the business. Is there a good strategy to invest early before everything is to late? As mentioned above, it’s really hard to make the case unless it’s tied to financial/reputational risk, which is more close to a postmortem analysis after something bad happens. It’s easier to start this effort if the leadership team pocesses such mindset of prioritizing quality, privacy, security traits of their product/service, and building a culture around them. . Another point that hits me is around 2:05:52. I found the full version of interview and will quote here. . WHAT’S WRONG WITH AI Julia Angwn: I strongly believe that in order to solve a problem, you have to diagnose it, and that we’re still in the diagnosis phase of this. If you think about the turn of the century and industrialization, we had, I don’t know, 30 years of child labor, unlimited work hours, terrible working conditions, and it took a lot of journalist muckraking and advocacy to diagnose the problem and have some understanding of what it was, and then the activism to get laws changed. I feel like we’re in a second industrialization of data information. I think some call it the second machine age. We’re in the phase of just waking up from the heady excitement and euphoria of having access to technology at our fingertips at all times. That’s really been our last 20 years, that euphoria, and now we’re like, “Whoa, looks like there’re some downsides.” I see my role as trying to make as clear as possible what the downsides are, and diagnosing them really accurately so that they can be solvable. That’s hard work, and lots more people need to be doing it. It’s increasingly becoming a field, but I don’t think we’re all the way there. . Dianosing and understanding the full picture of the problem is not an easy problem. It takes non-trivial time to identify the exact problem and serves as the starting point of crafting potential solution. On the one hand, if we don’t fully understand the problem, it may cost way more time and resource to pivot. On the other hand, we can’t spend endless time on diagnosing a problem, it’s not pratical in reality and we never make any progress to exercise some potential solutions to test our understanding. It’s always a evolving and dynamic process that we put enough time ahead to understand the problem, then design solution and test it, measure the results to create a feedback loop to adjust the initial understanding and design a better solution. .",

And it is naturally self-correcting as a whole, though not necessarily for its parts. For example, if there is too much supply and waste in a market, prices will go down, companies will go out of business, and capacity will be reduced until the supply falls in line with the demand, at which time the cycle will start to move in the opposite direction. Similarly, if an economy turns bad enough, those responsible for running it will make the political and policy changes that are needed or they will not survive, making room for their replacements to come along. These cycles are continuous and play out in logical ways and they tend to be self-reinforcing. . I believe that every entity needs to focus on evolving (or they will die out), making connection with the world while consuming input from it and producing output to it. It’s similar to a dot on a huge net, without connecting to other dots, it’s a an island, it never grows or influences other dots. . Why blogging .

            "content": "The following are quoted from a fast.ai notebook (04_mnist_basics) discussing Tenacity and Deep Learning. I want to share some reflection on this “touching” anecdote. . The story of deep learning is one of tenacity and grit by a handful of dedicated researchers. After early hopes (and hype!) neural networks went out of favor in the 1990’s and 2000’s, and just a handful of researchers kept trying to make them work well. Three of them, Yann Lecun, Yoshua Bengio, and Geoffrey Hinton, were awarded the highest honor in computer science, the Turing Award (generally considered the “Nobel Prize of computer science”), in 2018 after triumphing despite the deep skepticism and disinterest of the wider machine learning and statistics community. Geoff Hinton has told of how even academic papers showing dramatically better results than anything previously published would be rejected by top journals and conferences, just because they used a neural network. Yann Lecun’s work on convolutional neural networks, which we will study in the next section, showed that these models could read handwritten text—something that had never been achieved before. However, his breakthrough was ignored by most researchers, even as it was used commercially to read 10% of the checks in the US! In addition to these three Turing Award winners, there are many other researchers who have battled to get us to where we are today. For instance, Jurgen Schmidhuber (who many believe should have shared in the Turing Award) pioneered many important ideas, including working with his student Sepp Hochreiter on the long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture (widely used for speech recognition and other text modeling tasks, and used in the IMDb example in «chapter_intro»). Perhaps most important of all, Paul Werbos in 1974 invented back-propagation for neural networks, the technique shown in this chapter and used universally for training neural networks (Werbos 1994). His development was almost entirely ignored for decades, but today it is considered the most important foundation of modern AI. There is a lesson here for all of us! On your deep learning journey you will face many obstacles, both technical, and (even more difficult) posed by people around you who don’t believe you’ll be successful. There’s one guaranteed way to fail, and that’s to stop trying. We’ve seen that the only consistent trait amongst every fast.ai student that’s gone on to be a world-class practitioner is that they are all very tenacious. . It’s indeed a great story about tenacity and grit. I ask myself: If most of my peers were standing on the other side, could I still firmly hold on to my position and prove their validness? Unfortunately, I can’t give a postive answer. People are mostly social animal, we need to be supported, loved and believed by our peers. Otherwise, our lives are in a danger if abandoned by our “tribe”. Taking the alternative path and be the minorities needs tremendous courage and belief that the truth rests on their side. I don’t think it’s always worthing the correctness our beliefs and/or ideas and win the battle of argument every time. For example, when you and your partner have different opinions, there is no need to convince them you are the right one. If your parner is reasonable person or the issue may lead to consequences you can’t bear, then the strategies to reach the agreement are another story. . Another point is as a learner of deep learning, we should catiously pace of our learning, not too fast and not too slow. If we go through all the material too fast, we pay less attention on the key components which may backfire when we try to go deeper into the area. Building a solid foundation, especially learning stuff you have no exposure before, is a smart strategy in order to go fast in the future. If we move too slow, we may lose interests because we are making enough progress to get feedbacks. For example, if I spend a whole month figuring out every nitty gritty details of math and library details of fast.ai, I won’t feel any excitement and may eventually drop the class. The course structure is well designed by fast.ai team adopting a top-down approach to grasp the whole picture of deep learning, train some state-of-the-art models solving real life problem in lession 1 &amp; 2 and intentionally leave out math and other coding details. .",

            "content": "This is mostly inspired by a fast.ai MOOC: Practical Deep Learning for Coders.It used a top-down approach teaching the deep learning. Lesson 1 and 2 will directly build several the state of the art deep learning models by a few lines of code. . In this notebook, my goal is to train a model to tell the difference of my cat: Albus, a silver shaded british shorthair from all other british short hairs. There is little pratical utility of the model, though it can be extended to something like pet finder using cameras including CCTVs, phone&#39;s camera etc to help people find their missing pet. . As a reader, you just need some basic understanding of python (or similar) and really limited experience of coding such as variable assignment, import libraries, calling some functions. I will explain every step in this notebook of what it&#39;s achieving. . Import your libraries . This is some basic python code import fastai/fastbook libraries (built by fast.ai team) to your jupyter notebook so that you can use all classes, functions in the libraries. One thing you might notice, it&#39;s generally a bad habit to import *, but according to fast.ai mooc, they pay extra attention on this, and it only imports necessary artifacts into the notebook, so you don&#39;t have to worry to much about it. . from fastbook import * from fastai.vision.widgets import * . Prepare your data . In this step, it will prepare your training data. . For my pet Albus, I upload around 150 pictures into a folder british_shorthair/albus. | For the not_albus part, I use bing image search API to find around 150 silver shaded british shorthair images and download them into british_shorthair/albus.

Train your model . In the following code cell, it only contains 4 lines of code but it does quite a lot: . Line 1: It prepares your data for training your model. It returns a DataBlock which is a fast.ai class blocks=(ImageBlock, CategoryBlock): It tells datablock that the input data is image and label is category | get_items=get_image_files: it means when loading input item, it will use get_image_files function to load the data | splitter=RandomSplitter(valid_pct=0.2, seed=42): it means that a randomation split will be performed to split your data into training (80%) and validation (20%). Seed will guarantee everytime it does a separation, the result will be the same. | get_y=parent_label: it teams when load label, it will find the image&#39;s parent folder name as the label name, which is a common way to organize the data | item_tfms=RandomResizedCrop(224, min_scale=0.5): It applies item-wise transformation, which randomly resize and crop you image with size 224 px and minimum 50% of original image. | batch_tfms=aug_transforms(): It&#39;s using image augmentation technics to transform batch of images. It will flip, twist, adjust different stats of your images to generate &quot;new&quot; images for training purpose so that model can learn from different perspectives. | | Line 2: It loads the actual data from your path | Line 3: We use a cnn learner with our data, and resnet18 architecture and use error rate as our metrics. The architecture in our case is not supper important and it&#39;s a deep residual network pretrained on imagenet (more on https://pytorch.org/hub/pytorch_vision_resnet/). For error rate, you will see that at each epoch (iteration) of training, what percentage of images that model makes mistake predict the correct label on validation set. | Line 4: it uses transfer learning technics and you don&#39;t need to train the model from scatch.

            "content": "There are six leadership passages that a leader needs to go through. The book focuses on helping readers become familiar with the skills, time applications, and work values demanded by each passage, as well as this particular leadership gestalt. . Passage One: From Managing Self to Managing Others . Manageing self: They contribute by doing the assigned work within given time frames and in ways that meet objectives. By sharpening and boardening their individual skills, they make increased contributions and are then considered “promotable” by organizations. From a time application standpoint, the learning involves planning (so that work is completed on time), punctuality, content, quality, and reliability. The work values to be developed include acceptance of the company culture and adopting of professional standards. | Managing others: The skills people should learn at this first leadership passage include planning work, filling jobs, assigning work, motivating, coaching, and measuring the work of others.They must shift from “doing” work to getting work done through others. They must believe that making time for others, planning, coaching, and the like are necessary tasks and are their responsibility. More than that, they must view this other-directed work as mission-critical to their sucess. Passage Two: From Managing Others to Managing Managers . Perhaps the biggest difference from the previous passage is that here, managers must be pure management. Now they need to divest themselves of individual tasks. The key skills that must be mastered duration this transition include . | Selecting people to turn Passage One | Assigning managerial and leadership work to them | Measuring their progress as managers | Coaching them | Beginning to think beyond their function and concerning themselves with strategic issues that support the overall business One of the touch responsibility of managers of managers is to return people to individual-contributor roles if first-line managers don’t shift their behaviors and values Passage Three: From Managing Managers to Functional Manager . | Skills: New communication skills with individual contributors | Endeavor to understand areas that are outside their own experiences and also learn to value it | Team play with other functional managers and competition for resources based on business needs | Proficient strategiest, not only for their function but also for blending their functional strategy with the overall business strategy. | . | Time-application: Participating in business team meetings and working with other functional managers | Delegating responsibility for overseeing many functional tasks to direct reports | . | Value Long-term strategy, such as state-of-the-art, futuristic thinking for their function, is usually what gives most managers trouble. Passage Four: From Functional Manager to Business Manager . | . | Receive significant autonomy | In charge of integrating functions | From looking at plans and proposals functionally to a profit perspective and to a long-term view | Balancing act between future goals and present needs and making trade-offs between the two Passage Five: From Business Manager to Group Manager . | Similar managing self to managing others, a business manager values the success of his own business while a group manager values the success of other people’s businesses. | Evaluating strategy for resource allocation and deployment purposes. | Development of business managers | Portfolio strategy: Do I have the right collection of businesses? What to add, subtract and change? | Avoid wishful thinking and instead taking a hard, objective looking at their range of resources and making a judment based on analysis and experience. Passage Six: From Group Manager to Enterprise Manager . | Long term visionary thinkers | Develop operating mechanisms to know and drive quarter-by-quarter performance that is in tune with longer-term strategy. | Well-developed external sensitivity and the ability to manage external constituencies, sense significant external shifts, and do something about them proactively. | Let go of the pieces - that is, the individual products and customers - and focus on the whole | Assume a team of high-achieving and ambitious direct reports. | .",

            "content": "吃老本 . 前一篇聊了成为技术管理者后，不免会在技术上有所退步，我们首先要接受这个事实。那接受后是不是就可以安心地吃老本呢，当然不是。在现金这个社会，只需要一两年，甚至更短的时间内技术就会迭代，一年前火热的框架，可能在今年就会被另一套技术或是框架所替代。作为技术管理者，除非你在成为技术管理者前已经有大量的沉淀，对各种技术融汇贯通，否则老本真没几年好吃。 . Why/How/What . 那既然技术迭代得那么快，而管理者又不可能完全专注于技术上，那么就要着眼于顶层的架构，能够对自己领域内的系统的不同设计回答why, how和what。why其实是最重要的，核心是回答一个系统服务于解决一个什么现实中的问题，就比如消息队列是一种服务间的异步通讯方式，主要解决不需要同步（即时性）的操作的请求和应答。how是回答为了实现这个功能，从meta层面如何设计这个系统，这儿有一个比较好用的判断标准，你能不能在10分钟（甚至5分钟）就把这个系统的设计思路给一个有一定技术背景但没有结束过你的系统的人讲清楚系统是怎么运作的，并谈谈其关键指标，不同设计的优劣与分别适用于怎么样的场景、需求。这儿还是以消息队列来举例，最经典的kafka的模型，producer -&gt; broker/queue -&gt; consumer，一个或多个producer发送消息到broker的某个topic，一个或多个consumer可以订阅broker的topic来获得更新，这就是最基础的how。what注重于细节设计，注重一个系统里每个子系统的设计与实现，了解的深度可以更加因地制宜，但一些关键点还是需要知道的。比如消息队列中broker的persistent策略，consumer如何确保不会漏消系，遇到重复的消息应该怎么处理等等。 . Priority . 一个技术型公司当技术团队超过50人后一线技术管理者需要更了解how和what，而更高层级的管理者的应该更偏重why和how，放手what。这儿举个WhatsApp的例子，当WhatsApp在被FB收购前还只有10~30人左右的工程师团队时，每个人都非常hands on，也没有什么一线技术管理，只有工程师，一个工程师负责一大块的功能。当被收购后慢慢团队到了50-100人，就开始出现技术管理，这个阶段没有太多的层级，所以每个manager其实也还是输出一定代码的。后期发展到几百人的团队，不同的国家都有团队时，一线manager就不会再输出太多代码了（偶尔会有一些，因人而异），而senior manager及以上更多地就会注重why，how并且challenge手下一些what的问题，来获得二手的信息。 .",

            "content": "保持技术敏感度：为什么想要分享这个话题 . 想做成一个系列的分享，第一篇就写写为什么会想要分享这个话题。 管理者不是天生就是在管理的位置上，都会经过一份或者几分技术类的工作 (当然这里说的技术适用于很多领域比如市场，产品，销售等等，不仅仅是计算机相关的技术。当然因为我本身是做IT的，所以会以IT技术为例做分享)，最终成为一个管理者的。当然第一份工作就是创业的话会有一些些的不同，但即使你是创始人之一，也是同时在做技术类和管理类的工作。当一个人成为了管理者后，就会面对一个问题，你的主要职责是支持你的团队，以团队为你的最高优先级做出成绩。很多新的管理者，之前有着很出色的技术，会习惯于还在一线干活，或者还非常深入的参加技术层面的设计。很多国内的公司对于一线管理者的要求也是即负责技术也负责管理。这就对一线管理者提出了更高的要求，你既要懂技术，也要能带团队。一个人的时间是有限的，你不可能还像原先一样团身心的投入在技术层面，那怎么样能够保持技术能力、敏感度，又不耽误管理的任务呢。 在第一篇的最后，说一个Google/Facebook在管理者上的一个演变，当Google、Facebook还相对较小时，有一种Technical Lead Manager (TLM) 的职位，就是像上面所提到的你既要负责技术方向，也要带团队，甚至偶尔还要撸起袖子写代码(当团队处于紧急状态时)。而当公司渐渐成长了之后TLM越来越稀少，公司也越来越不鼓励成为TLM，TLM的职位被拆分成了Engineering Mangager (EM)和Tech Lead (TL, IC5+ engineer)，EM和TL往往要合作，一个偏重于团队，一个偏重于技术，但TL也要动一些管理，EM也要能理解现有技术，趋势和评价可行性等(可以不懂一些细节)。我认为一方面是公司大了，自然分工会更明确，在单方面集中精力自然会做的比同事兼顾多方面来的更好，但对于EM来说，尤其是空降的EM，会对技术方面也有要求，而往往管理的技术可以通用，但是技术不一定通用，如何快速了解团队的技术就成了一个大问题。 .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | .
