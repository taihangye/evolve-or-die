            "content": "“To paraphrase Einstein, you can’t solve your problems with the same mindset that created them. To live as a free person, following lists of easy, repetitive things, possibly in return for some reward, is exactly what should be avoided. Instead, it’s necessary to understand how the world works and how people have been specialized to the point of general incompetence, like ants, which only know how to do one job, but do it very well; this is not human nature. To live well, one must go beyond lists and start thinking creatively about solving problems.” . 用同样创造出问题的思维去解决问题是不可行的。比如一个人工作了很久还是觉得自己很穷，那他保持同样的工作方式，消费水平继续工作30年，也很难让他变得很富有。现在社会讲究分工来提高总体的生产效率，而忽略了人们最基本的生存技能，企图用一份工作赚的钱去支付另外的所有开销。这本身并不是一种自然的选择。 . What Gandhi said “Be the change you want to see”, may sound trite, but that doesn’t make it untrue. . 一个人怎么去影响身边的人乃至整个社会，成为一个你想要整个社会都成为的人。改变自己是我们唯一可以把握的，身教的力量远远超过言传。 . The question you need to answer is what you want to do with your life given that you don’t have the time to do everything? Do you want to spend most of your life paying off the interest of a 30-year mortgage and working so you can fill increasingly bigger houses with increasingly more stuff while being stuck in your daily communte in increasingly nicer cars? Or are you prepared to give up the stuff so that you can do whatever you want, whenever, and wherever, with reason? What will your legacy be-what you owned or who you were? . FIRE: 财富自由，提早退休。其实强调的重点在于财富自由。财富自由，并不是说你赚了大钱，而是你所拥有的财富足够长时间地支持日常的开销，而你不需要为了钱而做一些自己并不喜欢的事来换取支持生活的钱。提早退休也不代表着一般意义上60岁从一份工作中退休而不工作了，而是有自由去选择自己想做的事，从不得不做的事中退休。 . In other words, you need to believe your lifestyle as an end rather than as a means to an end. To wit, runners and other athletes sometimes get the reverse cum hoc ergo propter hoc comment that they’re already git, so they don’t need to exercise. Yet their diligent exercising is exactly what causes their fitness. How is doing good, creating wealth, establishing connections-in short, accomplishing anything-any different? . 把过程(因)作为终极目的，而不是结果最为终极目的。运动带来好的身材，并不意味着运动员就不需要运动了(因为他们已经有好身材了)，而是因为他们运动才有的好身材。 . “Barriers represent a cost which must be paid. The willingness to pay depends on a combination of dissatisfaction with the present situation, vision of the future situation, and the practicality of changing from the present situation to the future situation. This will to change can be represented by the volume of the pyramid in the figure.” . . Increase your dissatisfaction with present situation. | Strengthen your vision of future situation. | Build a plan to get from the present to the future. | Lower the perceived cost of the plan. | 对现状越不满，对未来的状况越有清晰的目标，对计划越有具体的规划，对计划的成本越有清晰的认识，实际做出改变的概率就越大。 .",

            "content": "这本书是2010年写的，Jacob Lund Fisker是比较早期Financial Independence Retire Early (FIRE)的倡导者。FIRE到后面也分成了LEAN FIRE, FAT FIRE等等很多种，而这本书主要是偏向于LEAN FIRE，大致就是尽可能削减生活成本，用很短的时间实现财务自由（作者用了5年）。作者在书中主要说了一种文艺复兴的人类，学习很多技能，尽可能自己做事，从各方面降低生活成本，避免消费主义陷阱，也给出了挺多实打实的计算（虽然不是重点）。书本身比较偏向于哲学而不是方法论，作者相信每个人有每个人自己的FIRE，而过多描述他自己的FIRE本身意义不大，授人以鱼不如授人以渔。 . “At some point, the teacher introduced tests and grades. Test-taking became the primary objective; learning secondary. We had the option to quickly forget what we had spent the past year learning after the test was done. In other words, we were being taught to be “flexible.” Later, there were job fairs and educational fairs telling us how to write résumés and how to interview so we could get jobs. Yet, I never learned why the world worked the way it did, and in retrospect, I think nobody ever even asked the question. Everybody always only focused on the “what” and “where;” no questions asked.” . 高度的分工，工业的生产让整个社会的效率提高了无数倍，需要的是每颗螺丝钉的专精和服从，随时可能被替换。学校训练最多也是服从，在学校服从老师，追求成绩，在社会服从老板，追求业绩，一条龙。 . “In real life, the prisoners of Plato’s Cave are those who are prisoners or slaves to their wages and their culture. A wage slave is a wage earner who is entirely dependent on their wages. While the wage slave is free to leave the current job, he isn’t free to leave the job market altogether and he can likely not imagine the possibility of doing so. He is still entirely focused on the wall.” . “A wage slave is a person who is not only economically bound by mortgages, loans, and other obligations, but also mentally bound by an inability to perceive that there are other options available, like the prisoners in Plato’s Cave. Their chains are not physical like those of 150 years ago (though they still are in some parts of the world); the chains are mental, which in some sense makes them worse, because it turns the prisoners into their own prison wardens. Like the slaves in Plato’s Cave, the only commonly accepted way for one of them to leave is to win the “prison game,” which means accumulating at least a million to retire” . 柏拉图的洞穴理论。看似的自由，比如人可以选择自己从事的工作，这本身就是被限制在了大前提，一个成人在现代社会一定要工作。在这种理论下，成功的定义就是一直工作知道积累了足够退休的财富。自我的思想的束缚比150年前物理的铁链还要有效果，毕竟人不可能做自己认知之外的事，不认为自己有除了“一直工作到退休”以外的可能性这个枷锁本身是非常可怕的。 . “Frequently, when someone is depressed, the advice is “Go out and spend some money. Buy yourself something nice. Treat yourself. Try a little retail therapy.” People don’t seem to realize that this attempt to feel good is exactly what propagates the problem. Compared to people just 50 years ago, modern wage slaves live a life of material abundance. They’re consumers” . “Similarly, many of the ways we used to do things have been redesigned to ensure that instead of doing it ourselves, we can buy some gadget or some service to have it done for us. This is convenient, because we’re usually too busy working to pay for it to do it ourselves” . 消费主义和高度分工是一个闭环。一个人只会做自己的工作，工作赚的钱来以相对的高价买其他的产品和服务，越工作，越只会一小部分事，越用钱去娱乐、缓解压力、满足各种需要，欲望也就越大，就只能越努力工作去赚赚钱。 .",

            "content": "这本书是作者采访一些“天才疯子”（主要是精神病人）的记录，每一章都是一个很有意思的小故事。 . 唯物论也好，唯心论也好，其实不冲突，大家看待事物的角度不一样。只要不用自己所掌握的去祸害别人，那就算自我认识提高了，没什么大惊小怪的。像我前面说的：你不相信并不能影响客观现实的存在 . 世界很大，容得下不同的理解。别把自己的理解强加给别人，而是分享给别人，产生一些思想的碰撞。对于自己不相信的东西，不了解的东西不要妄下结论，你不相信不代表他客观存在也不代表别人不相信。 . “我：“你没明白，死这个概念太复杂了，我用了其中一种而已。也算是自我暗示的。每天睡前，我都会告诉自己：我即将死了，但是明天会重新出生的。” 她：“明白了，真的可以那样吗？” 我：“不知道对别人是不是管用，但我很接受自己的这种暗示。每天早上，我都是新生，一切都是过去式了。虽然会有记忆，但那种状态只是一种时间旅行的状态，重点在于：旅行。就象出去旅游，心里明白总要回家的，这样思维上的死结很快就解开了，就是说跳出来了。每当面对一个新患者的时候，我总是尽可能的全身心去接受，全身心的融入，尽可能谦卑，尽可能的让对方放大自己的空间，我可以背负着全部。但是当晚，我死了，我卸下了全部。比方说情感方面卸下了，而那些观点和知识作为资料收起来，就象人体内的淋巴系统一样，病毒碎片收集起来，增加了免疫力。其实电脑杀毒软件不就是那个原理吗？我也借用了，借用在思维上。不是我多强大，而是我学会了一种状态，用精神上的仿生淋巴系统来自我保护。” 她：“……朝生暮死……” . 这是一种很奇妙的状态，每天都代表着新生，也代表着死亡，当下的正面负面的感受都打包整理化为养分。 . 问题就出来了，好人，其实代表的就是一个社会价值观。什么样的社会价值观呢？一个标准环境下的社会价值观：你要勤奋工作，才能融入社会，做社会的一份子，成为社会的一个组成个体。好好工作，孝敬父母，娶妻生子，最后安享天年。为什么要这样呢？因为社会需要这样的人，需要大量这样的人，如果都不这样，社会就不存在了，就成黑社会啦！不过，我很想知道大家真的都是这样安于现状吗？我觉得不是，但是又都没有特别聪明的脑袋，所以只好先这样过了。而且，没聪明脑袋的人是绝大多数，实际上到了这个时候，不聪明的人才是社会的真正组成者，个别有那么一点儿聪明，又不够坏的人只好安于现状，因为真正主导这个社会的，是不聪明的人。不管你怎么样，都不许出头，都按下去，老老实实按照一个模式走出来。你想出头？不可能的，你周围都是不聪明人组成的团体，怎么会让一个有点儿聪明的人发挥呢？其实这才是一个根本性的要点. . “问题就在于，有一部分很聪明的人发现了这点，但是又没别的办法，只好当坏人了，因为最快的获取方式，不是成功，而是掠夺。如果你读的世界史足够，你就会明白，欧美的强大，依靠的不是文明或者宗教，是掠夺。他们的生活方式甚至都是这样的。比方说他们治病吧，怎么治？把病毒也好，细菌也好，杀死在体内，杀不死，那个人就死了呗，他们会说：神不放开这个人。” . 原来依靠武力掠夺，现在依靠精神掠夺。人再厉害也躲不过社会国家的大背景，顺势而为是大多数人的选择。而真正的天才或者疯子，往往决定他们命运的就是成败。比如怀特兄弟如果飞机没有发明成功而摔死了，现在可能甚至没人知道他们，或者觉得是两个神经病，人怎么可能能飞呢。 . “所以杀人到底是对错的概念不是你决定的，而是你所在的群体决定的。你的群体赋予你杀人的权利了，你就可以杀。不给你杀人的权利，你杀人是要受惩罚的。因为你没有杀人牌照。” . 同样是杀人，没经过允许的杀人就成了杀人犯，经过允许的杀人（比如战争）就承认战斗英雄，但站在对立方确实“大魔头”。还是回到上面的一点，谁成功了制定了标准和规则。 .",

You can be wrong half the time and still make a fortune, because a small minority of things account for the majority of outcomes.” “It is fine to have a large chunk of poor investments and a few outstanding ones. That’s usually the best-case scenario.” . 其实人生大部分的走势也就是几个决定的事。精力总是有限的，平均投入到所有细节中只会分散了核心问题所能获得的关注。 . “Use money to gain control over your time, because not having control of your time is such a powerful and universal drag on happiness. The ability to do what you want, when you want, with who you want, for as long as you want to, pays the highest dividend that exists in finance.” . 什么是自由。自由就是不被定义，不被当成工具在别人指定的时间、地点，做指定的事，而可以在我想要的时间、地点做我想做的事。 . “Savings that aren’t earmarked for anything in particular is a hedge against life’s inevitable ability to surprise the hell out of you at the worst possible moment.” . 这是中国人习以为常的事，但在西方社会需要被特意提出来说，毕竟大家习惯了举债生活。 . “Define the cost of success and be ready to pay it. Because nothing worthwhile is free.” . 愿意为成功付出代价，尤其是别天真地以为投资的成功没有代价。 . “Room for error often looks like a conservative hedge, but if it keeps you in the game it can pay for itself many times over.” . 给自己留余地。 . “Define the game you’re playing, and make sure your actions are not being influenced by people playing a different game. . Respect the mess. Smart, informed, and reasonable people can disagree in finance, because people have vastly different goals and desires. There is no single right answer; just the answer that works for you.” . 了解自己，别被和你玩不一样游戏的人所影响自己的决定。 . “Sandy Gottesman, a billionaire investor who founded the consulting group First Manhattan, is said to ask one question when interviewing candidates for his investment team: “What do you own, and why?” . 这确实是no bs，show me your money. . “I mostly just want to wake up every day knowing my family and I can do whatever we want to do on our own terms. Every financial decision we make revolves around that goal.” . 财富自由不是为了赚更多的钱为目标，而是实现能够自由的选择过自己的生活。 . “On the rare occasion when I question our savings rate I think of the independence my parents earned from years of high savings, and I quickly come back. Independence is our top goal. A secondary benefit of maintaining a lifestyle below what you can afford is avoiding the psychological treadmill of keeping up with the Joneses. Comfortably living below what you can afford, without much desire for more, removes a tremendous amount of social pressure that many people in the modern first world subject themselves to. Nassim Taleb explained: “True success is exiting some rat race to modulate one’s activities for peace of mind.” I like that.” . 实现自由是首要目标，自己的收入水平大于自己满意的生活水平。避免社会压力与比较，rat race是永远不会有尽头的。 . “Effectively all of our net worth is a house, a checking account, and some Vanguard index funds.” “My investing strategy doesn’t rely on picking the right sector, or timing the next recession. It relies on a high savings rate, patience, and optimism that the global economy will create value over the next several decades. I spend virtually all of my investing effort thinking about those three things—especially the first two, which I can control.” . 做着自己的投资组合：20%左右的cash让自己睡个好觉，一个全款的房子，剩下的所有钱都在一些Vanguard指数基金里。非常简单。 .",

Partly because the stakes are so high in investing.” “Consider that 85% of active mutual funds underperformed their benchmark over the 10 years ending 2018.⁶⁵ That figure has been fairly stable for generations. You would think an industry with such poor performance would be a niche service and have a hard time staying in business. But there’s almost five trillion dollars invested in these funds.⁶” . 人们想通过投资赚钱，所以听一些电视“专家”的意见，这些专家自己也没什么可以证明投资逻辑的案例，甚至从数据上来说，满满的“失败”的案例。 . “Everyone has an incomplete view of the world. But we form a complete narrative to fill in the gaps.” “[History] cannot be interpreted without the aid of imagination and intuition. The sheer quantity of evidence is so overwhelming that selection is inevitable. Where there is selection there is art. Those who read history tend to look for what proves them right and confirms their personal opinions. They defend loyalties. They read with a purpose to affirm or to attack. They resist inconvenient truth since everyone wants to be on the side of the angels. Just as we start wars to end all wars.” “Hindsight, the ability to explain the past, gives us the illusion that the world is understandable. It gives us the illusion that the world makes sense, even when it doesn’t make sense. That’s a big deal in producing mistakes in many fields.” . 每个人都不可能完全的客观，有选择就有艺术。人们永远在尝试解释这个世界，很多的理论都是建立在一些公理上的，这些公理一旦被推翻，那所有的理论就自然不成立。这并不是说理论没有用，而是什么时候用什么样的理论很重要。 . “Wanting to believe we are in control is an emotional itch that needs to be scratched, rather than an analytical problem to be calculated and solved. The illusion of control is more persuasive than the reality of uncertainty. So we cling to stories about outcomes being in our control.” . 控制感是一种自我和解。虽然绝大部分人没有办法控制自己的命运，总是在随波逐流。 .",

Optimism is a belief that the odds of a good outcome are in your favor over time, even when there will be setbacks along the way. The simple idea that most people wake up in the morning trying to make things a little better and more productive than wake up looking to cause trouble is the foundation of optimism. It’s not complicated. It’s not guaranteed, either. It’s just the most reasonable bet for most people, most of the time. The late statistician Hans Rosling put it differently: “I am not an optimist. I am a very serious possibilist.” . 乐观主义：自己长期的行为能够让天平为自己倾斜一点。 . “Tell someone that everything will be great and they’re likely to either shrug you off or offer a skeptical eye. Tell someone they’re in danger and you have their undivided attention.” “When directly compared or weighted against each other, losses loom larger than gains. This asymmetry between the power of positive and negative expectations or experiences has an evolutionary history. Organisms that treat threats as more urgent than opportunities have a better chance to survive and reproduce.” “progress happens too slowly to notice, but setbacks happen too quickly to ignore.” “Growth is driven by compounding, which always takes time. Destruction is driven by single points of failure, which can happen in seconds, and loss of confidence, which can happen in an instant.” . 人的本性总是生存是第一位的。好事需要长期的积累，坏事往往只要全局中有一点坏了，就会牵连整个局势。 . “Expecting things to be great means a best-case scenario that feels flat. Pessimism reduces expectations, narrowing the gap between possible outcomes and outcomes you feel great about. . Maybe that’s why it’s so seductive. Expecting things to be bad is the best way to be pleasantly surprised when they’re not. . Which, ironically, is something to be optimistic about.” . 降低自己的预期，当结果非常好的时候就会成为惊喜。这何尝不是一种乐观的精神。 .",

If an asset has momentum—it’s been moving consistently up for a period of time—it’s not crazy for a group of short-term traders to assume it will keep moving up. Not indefinitely; just for the short period of time they need it to. Momentum attracts short-term traders in a reasonable way.” . 对于跟踪momentum的投资者，即使价格再不合理，在短期内的操作也是合理的。 . “Data from Attom, a company that tracks real estate transactions, shows the number of houses in America that sold more than once in a 12-month period—they were flipped—rose fivefold during the bubble, from 20,000 in the first quarter of 2000 to over 100,000 in the first quarter of 2004.⁵⁴ Flipping plunged after the bubble to less than 40,000 per quarter, where it’s roughly remained since. .

It’s volatility, fear, doubt, uncertainty, and regret—all of which are easy to overlook until you’re dealing with them in real time.” . 任何事情都是有“价格”的。成功的投资的代价就是波动，恐惧，怀疑，不确定性以及后悔。 . “Many people in investing choose the third option. Like a car thief—though well-meaning and law-abiding—they form tricks and strategies to get the return without paying the price. They trade in and out. They attempt to sell before the next recession and buy before the next boom. Most investors with even a little experience know that volatility is real and common. Many then take what seems like the next logical step: trying to avoid it. . But the Money Gods do not look highly upon those who seek a reward without paying the price. Some car thieves will get away with it. Many more will be caught and punished.” . 这里作者举了一个车的例子：你可以选择买新车接受价格的波动，你可以买个便宜的二手车选择相对低的不确定性，你也可以选择偷一辆车选择不付出金钱。类比投资，很多人选择“偷”车，只能赚钱不能亏钱，以为自己能够长期做到低买高卖，付出很少的代价（波动性，风险）去赚更多的钱。 . “Morningstar once looked at the performance of tactical mutual funds, whose strategy is to switch between stocks and bonds at opportune times, capturing market returns with lower downside risk.⁵⁰ They want the returns without paying the price. The study focused on the mid-2010 through late 2011 period, when U.S. stock markets went wild on fears of a new recession and the S&amp;P 500 declined more than 20%. This is the exact kind of environment the tactical funds are supposed to work in. It was their moment to shine. . There were, by Morningstar’s count, 112 tactical mutual funds during this period. Only nine had better risk-adjusted returns than a simple 60/40 stock-bond fund. Less than a quarter of the “tactical funds had smaller maximum drawdowns than the leave-it-alone index. Morningstar wrote: “With a few exceptions, [tactical funds] gained less, were more volatile, or were subject to just as much downside risk” as the hands-off fund.” . 太多的事实证明很多所谓的“策略”都是“失败”的：付出更多风险，收获更少，或是不能避免downside risk。这还是和60/40的无脑组合相比。 . “The question is: Why do so many people who are willing to pay the price of cars, houses, food, and vacations try so hard to avoid paying the price of good investment returns? . The answer is simple: The price of investing success is not immediately obvious. It’s not a price tag you can see, so when the bill comes due it doesn’t feel like a fee for getting something good. It feels like a fine for doing something wrong. And while people are generally fine with paying fees, fines are supposed to be avoided. You’re supposed to make decisions that preempt and avoid fines. Traffic fines and IRS fines mean you did something wrong and deserve to be punished. The natural response for anyone who watches their wealth decline and views that drop as a fine is to avoid future fines. ” . 人们把投资的波动性，风险当成了罚款，是需要避免的，而不是本身就需要的成本。 .",

Endurance is key.” . 复利效应其实应该有另一个角度：即使是在小的负面影响，通过不断地积累也会也有很大的英雄。“鸡毛蒜皮”“柴米油盐”的“小事”并不是简单地以加法积累的。从量变到质变会有一个turning point。 . “Sunk costs—anchoring decisions to past efforts that can’t be refunded—are a devil in a world where people change over time. They make our future selves prisoners to our past, different, selves. It’s the equivalent of a stranger making major life decisions for you. . Embracing the idea that financial goals made when you were a different person should be abandoned without mercy versus put on life support and dragged on can be a good strategy to minimize future regret.” . 沉默成本，是让未来的自己成为过去那个“不同”自己的囚犯。生活中有太多的例子是关于沉默成本的，比如一旦选择了一个专业，尤其是付出了很多心血读到了phd，就不想转行，即使这个专业是当年某个老师、长辈建议的，自己并不怎么喜欢的，太多的人还是放弃了自己重新选择的机会。他们喜欢说“当时某某某帮我选的，我没有选择” .",

Think of it like this, and one of the most powerful ways to increase your savings isn’t to raise your income. It’s to raise your humility. When you define savings as the gap between your ego and your income you realize why many people with decent incomes save so little. It’s a daily struggle against instincts to extend your peacock feathers to their outermost limits and keep up with others doing the same. People with enduring personal finance success—not necessarily those with high incomes—tend to have a propensity to not give a damn what others think about them. . 越在意自己的外在，越想要满足自己无尽的炫耀的需求，那存款也就相对越少。 . “Only saving for a specific goal makes sense in a predictable world. But ours isn’t. Saving is a hedge against life’s inevitable ability to surprise the hell out of you at the worst possible moment.” . 存款是不可预知风险的对冲。 . “In a world where intelligence is hyper-competitive and many previous technical skills have become automated, competitive advantages tilt toward nuanced and soft skills—like communication, empathy, and, perhaps most of all, flexibility. If you have flexibility you can wait for good opportunities, both in your career and for your investments. You’ll have a better chance of being able to learn a new skill when it’s necessary. You’ll feel less urgency to chase competitors who can do things you can’t, and have more leeway to find your passion and your niche at your own pace. You can find a new routine, a slower pace, and think about life with a different set of assumptions. The ability to do those things when most others can’t is one of the few things that will set you apart in a world where intelligence is no longer a sustainable advantage.

That’s all that happens.” The great art dealers operated like index funds. They bought everything they could. And they bought it in portfolios, not individual pieces they happened to like. Then they sat and waited for a few winners to emerge.” . 艺术品行业做的就像指数基金。 . “A lot of things in business and investing work this way. Long tails—the farthest ends of a distribution of outcomes—have tremendous influence in finance, where a small number of events can account for the majority of outcomes.” . Power law在投资中的体现，不仅是public market是这样，private market也是这样。推荐看看这篇关于天使投资回报的研究：https://www.angellist.com/blog/what-angellist-data-says-about-power-law-returns-in-venture-capital . Investment firm Correlation Ventures once crunched the numbers.²⁰ Out of more than 21,000 venture financings from 2004 to 2014: . 65% lost money. | Two and a half percent of investments made 10x–20x. | One percent made more than a 20x return. | Half a percent—about 100 companies out of 21,000—earned 50x or more. That’s where the majority of the industry’s returns come from. | . 这个数据也印证了power law . “Over the course of your lifetime as an investor the decisions that you make today or tomorrow or next week will not matter nearly as much as what you do during the small number of days—likely 1% of the time or less—when everyone else around you is going crazy.” . 在人生的所有选择中也是1%的选择起到了决定性的作用，其实就是几个瞬间的事。但平时如何武装自己去准备那些不知道什么时候需要去做的选择是人们能做的。这儿还提到了一个有意思的点，当别人都在做疯狂事情的时候，如何控制自己做符合逻辑的事，是真正的天才。 . “When we pay special attention to a role model’s successes we overlook that their gains came from a small percent of their actions. That makes our own failures, losses, and setbacks feel like we’re doing something wrong. But it’s possible we are wrong, or just sort of right, just as often as the masters are. They may have been more right when they were right, but they could have been wrong just as often as you. “It’s not whether you’re right or wrong that’s important,” George Soros once said, “but how much money you make when you’re right and how much you lose when you’re wrong.” . 当你做了正确的决定时，如何获取最大的收益也是非常关键的。这就有点像德州扑克，在关键手牌中，你拿着坚果，如何从第二坚果手中赢下最多的钱也很重要。另一个例子，如果你投的种子轮的公司有1个在A轮要被几家非常有名的VC投了，产品和利润增长都很可观，那是否使用pro rata rights追加投资就很重要了。 .",

It requires humility, and fear that what you’ve made can be taken away from you just as fast. It requires frugality and an acceptance that at least some of what you’ve made is attributable to luck, so past success can’t be relied upon to repeat indefinitely.” . 打天下和守天下需要的是两种思维模式，如何做到自由地切换真的很难。 . “Not “growth” or “brains” or “insight.” The ability to stick around for a long time, without wiping out or being forced to give up, is what makes the biggest difference. This should be the cornerstone of your strategy, whether it’s in investing or your career or a business you own.” – Michael Moritz, the billionaire head of Sequoia Capital . 现在人们会被如何成功吸引，但”成功”之后如何保持不被踢出局是非常难的。 . “Say cash earns 1% and stocks return 10% a year. That 9% gap will gnaw at you every day. But if that cash prevents you from having to sell your stocks during a bear market, the actual return you earned on that cash is not 1% a year—it could be many multiples of that, because preventing one desperate, ill-timed stock sale can do more for your lifetime returns than picking dozens of big-time winners.” . 这段话其实蛮打动我的。我们投资的时候考虑放多少现金及等价物总是考虑收益率，感觉太低了（低于通膨），所以不愿意放过多的现金。一般美国的FA都是建议放5%~10%(除了紧急备用金外)。但作者说的如果现金太少导致很多时候你需要卖出股票来应急，那其实现金的收益率就不能只算纸面上的。 . “Many bets fail not because they were wrong, but because they were mostly right in a situation that required things to be exactly right. Room for error—often called margin of safety—is one of the most underappreciated forces in finance. It comes in many forms: A frugal budget, flexible thinking, and a loose timeline—anything that lets you live happily with a range of outcomes. It’s different from being conservative. Conservative is avoiding a certain level of risk. Margin of safety is raising the odds of success at a given level of risk by increasing your chances of survival. Its magic is that the higher your margin of safety, the smaller your edge needs to be to have a favorable outcome.” . 多给自己留一些放错的空间。这就和工作有些类似，也许你觉得你加加班1周能做完一件事，但防止有任何突发情况，在做计划的时候可以先预估两周。 . “Optimism is usually defined as a belief that things will go well. But that’s incomplete. Sensible optimism is a belief that the odds are in your favor, and over time things will balance out to a good outcome even if what happens in between is filled with misery.” . 乐观主义是相信长期来说事物向好的方向发展的可能性更大，虽然中间会有很多曲折。 . “A barbelled personality—optimistic about the future, but paranoid about what will prevent you from getting to the future—is vital.” . 对未来乐观但处处小心谨慎。记得有种杠铃投资法则，90%低风险(全球化的指数基金组合)+10%超高风险(VC, PE, Angel investing, start-ups)，对于90%的组合不需要你太多的精力，无论是涨还是跌，都不需要动，让复利和时间工作，对于10%的投资组合，需要你花大量的时间，因为其实就是一种赌博，需要投入时间研究来获得insights and edges。但无论是90%还是10%，都需要多元化，小额买入很多的资产，比如天使投资人不会把所有钱就压1家公司，一般种子轮的公司都会投个30~40家甚至更多，然后追加投资给胜出者。 .",

But the most powerful and important book should be called Shut Up And Wait. It’s just one page with a long-term chart of economic growth.” “You can’t blame people for devoting all their effort—effort in what they learn and what they do—to trying to earn the highest investment returns.

A trap many investors fall into is what I call “historians as prophets” fallacy: An overreliance on past data as a signal to future conditions in a field where innovation and change are the lifeblood of progress.” . 这儿有两种比较对立的观点。一种说法是历史总是在重复上演，另一种是历史无法完全预测未来。我觉得第一种说法应该改一下，人类总是在重复同样的错误。我们既要从过去的经验中吸取经验教训，也要对现在和未来的情况有就事论事的观察，从而做出综合的判断。很多建立在过去的客观前提和假设的结论是无法直接应用在新的情景中的，最多有一些借鉴意义，但还是要因地制宜，而不是循规蹈矩。 . “The correct lesson to learn from surprises is that the world is surprising. Not that we should use past surprises as a guide to future boundaries; that we should use past surprises as an admission that we have no idea what might happen next.” . 承认极端的”黑天鹅“和异常事件、人物都是无法预测的。 . “What this means, in effect, is that all historical data going back just a few decades about how startups are financed is out of date. What we know about investment cycles and startup failure rates is not a deep base of history to learn from, because the way companies are funded today is such a new historical paradigm.” . 承接上面的观点，很多从数据中得出的经验和模式是基于过去的数据的。如果数据本身的模式就发生了变化，你还用过去的模型去预测未来，来注定是失败的。在数据科学领域有一句很著名的话: Gargage in Gargage out. . “But since economies evolve, recent history is often the best guide to the future, because it’s more likely to include important conditions that are relevant to the future.” . 这段让我想起了最近看的一个机器学习的例子，把一些久远的数据从训练集中删除，反而提高了最终模型的准确度。对于个人来说太过久远的经验可能会起到反作用，学会忘记很重要。 . “It comes from investor John Templeton’s view that “The four most dangerous words in investing are, ‘it’s different this time.’” Templeton, though, admitted that it is different at least 20% of the time. The world changes. Of course it does. And those changes are what matter most over time. Michael Batnick put it: “The twelve most dangerous words in investing are, ‘The four most dangerous words in investing are, ‘it’s different this time.’” . 这段话蛮好玩的。其实也就是表达历史是不是在重演的问题。 .",

It’s not rational, until you consider that investing is effectively giving money to strangers.

The talented employee may join a company because of its charismatic leaders, its generous benefits, and its world-class training programs, but how long that employee stays and how productive he is while he is there is determined by his relationship with his immediate supervisor. . 蛮赞同这句话的，但经理的好坏是很重要的因素之一，并不是唯一的因素，还有比如公司整体的文化，同事的水平和能力，个人的能力抱负与公司所能给予的平台的匹配程度都有关系。这儿就聊聊经理这一项，自己的感受是在Oracle做物联网云的时候在两年内有过4个经理： . 第一任经理因为相处的时间不长，而且我刚初出茅庐，所以唯一留下的印象能相信新人，并安排适当难度的任务和资源给我，让我快速上手建立信心 | 第二任经理相处的时间最长（后来成为了skip），他算是老江湖了，成为我经理的时候已经是Director等级了，所以对于技术细节已经多年不碰了，但成功的点在于新人团队的技术领袖，不会越权来看我们每天做了啥，更多的会争取资源，解决团队出现的问题比如需要延期的沟通等等。我对于他的印象是相对最多，也是最好的。有意思的是前阵子还给他内推了Facebook，说了很多好话。 | 第三任经理是第二个经理的手下，因为团队的扩大和重构，我就归到他手下了。有趣的是他是负责另一个Saas的，和我做的是sibling，但我其实还是和我原来的skip开会，原来的团队干活。第三个经历基本和我没啥沟通，除了一些签证身份的问题，基本没有交集，感觉就是挂个名负责一些我的日常（虽然也没有常规的1：1） | 第四任经理也是我skip的手下，她属于比较micromanagement，会盯着你做一些任务，会安排做一些面试之类的，但是其实也不是很懂技术，比较喜欢做项目管理之类的事。 总体来说Oracle的经理们没有给我留下很好的印象，至少我不会觉得我从他们身上学到了什么，或者给了我什么成长和支持。常规的一对一，职业发展的一些讨论，提供及时有效的反馈等等这些都是不存在的。而且本身也看不出技术的大局观，感觉基本是纯管理路线。反倒是在有限的几次和GVP接触，觉得他还是很有技术的sense，虽然可能对细节不懂，但很能点出关键点和可能的问题风险之类的，给我留下了蛮深的印象。 到了Facebook/WhatsApp后，3年一共经理3任经理： | 第一任经理接触的时间也不长，但他是整个团队的创始人，走技术流，大神级别的程序员，所有东西都是一手从0写出来的，所以在技术上有绝对的话语权。和他讨论过几次技术问题，前几次感觉不好接近，问了问题也得不到直接的回答（他的回答基本都是以他能理解的方式和我说，完全没考虑我的context）。其实这样的经理总体来说是一件坏事，虽然技术非常强，但是完全没有做经理的sense，不懂如果带团队，不懂得如果有效的激励和赋能。随着时间的推移，他逐渐发现了问题，也开始有所进步。 | 第二任经理是我刚加入的时候就确定要接手团队的，所以和他的互动是最多的。他技术也很强（和第一任是不同类型的），之前也是因为喜欢做技术，所以没有转经理路线。和他每周的一对一以及开会，总能把事情讲明白，对我技术成熟度上有很大的帮助。同时也非常愿意放手让我去做，并给我指引方向，提供很多及时的反馈。让我在短时间内有了长足的进步，还是很感谢有这样的经理的。 | 第三任，也就是现在的经理，风格和前两任也不相同。他的风格会比较坦率，比如我喜欢自己带团队做事，那他就会放手让我管技术，他只管人事，我每次对他的汇报他会仔细看，并且提出一些问题，看我是否能很好的回答，或是问我有没有什么地方需要他帮忙的，他也会对需要他比较深度介入的地方直接介入并提供有效的反馈。同时我感觉他虽然对于技术也很有热情，但成为经理后，不会直接插手技术的选型，而是旁敲侧击的提出问题，让技术领导者和团队成员去思考。他会更关注团队的文化，士气，成员的状态，团队未来的发展方向等等。 总结来说FB的经理总体素质上确实要比Oracle好很多，这和对经理的培训，很多领导团队的耳濡目染有关。经理们的第一目标是支持团队更好的工作，同时要求有技术能力(对于Software engineer manager需要IC6+才能转成经理，IC6基本等于阿里的P9)。 | .",

            "content": "Chapter 27: 月报 . I would like a monthly update from you that includes the key metrics for the business, as well as what you consider the wins and losses since the last email. I would like you to put requests for me and your other investors in the email as well. Every email should have how much cash you have left, your burn rate, and when you will be out of cash so that we can all plan for future raises. . “When you do get a new report, it’s wise to read it fully and send a short follow-up with some positivity for what’s working (“nice work landing that head of sales”) while being understanding about the losses (“Sorry you lost your CTO. Is there a job description I can share on LinkedIn?”). Depending on your related experience, there are always ways for you to be helpful. I like to pose these as questions, as opposed to edicts. For example, consider these two statements: “You need to do Facebook ads.” and “Have you considered doing Facebook ads?” . Chapter 28: 跟投与救急 . When founders from strong companies raise another round, they will simply let you know that they’ve found a new investor, hopefully a venture capitalist who also wants to join the board, and tell you “what the new terms are and ask if you want to take your pro rata. You will have a date by which to respond yea or nay to reinvest or get diluted by the new money coming into the company. This doesn’t happen too often, and when it does, you should spend as much time as possible figuring out what this new investor sees in your startup. If new money is willing to pay a higher price, it probably means you picked a winner and you might want to consider putting in another $100,000. If this was a $25,000 bet, you will be quadrupling down, and if you did this as a syndicate for $1,000, you will be, ummm, maybe hundred-upling?! Centupling. . When deciding to give a bridge, you need to have a candid talk with the founders about what the bridge will accomplish, typically by having them present some goals and what the startup will look like when this new tranche of capital comes in. “What you see here is a pattern. Founders believe that one magical event is going to save the startup, be it adding a feature or a team member or a customer. You have to ask yourself two questions when presented with this strategy. First, is it true that this one event will change their trajectory? Second, is it possible to reach that event given these additional resources? . Chapter 29: 心态、策略、成长、长期的眼光 . These days, when something blows up, I tend to move pretty quickly from an initial reaction of an “Oh fuck!” to an “Oh well” and then to “Okay, now let’s focus on what’s working.” It sucks to lose, but the more time and energy you put into your losses, the more you will feel like a loser. Instead, you should have been quadrupling down on your winners and spending more time on them. . If you’re constantly learning and working hard—two things that are in your control—good things will happen. This goes equally for founders and investors, which is why my reality show catchphrase is going to be “Do the work. . You don’t need to win every pot. You don’t need to win every day. You do need to win in the long term. Think about angel investing as a decadelong pursuit. . Chapter 30: 退出方式 . When an IPO happens, your previously illiquid shares, which lived on a spreadsheet at the company, are magically transferred into your E-Trade, Charles Schwab, or—ideally—Wealthfront account (see chapter 9; I’m an advisor). These shares are typically locked up for the first six months you own them, but after that “lockup period” you can do what you want with them. . A market for selling private company shares emerged. The reasons for this are (1) the perfect storm of private companies not wanting to go public too soon and (2) the availability of massive pools of private funds from private equity and late-stage venture capital firms wanting to own significant positions in those companies. . If you have a winner and it’s surging, it’s tough to sell knowing that your equity is likely to grow. But taking 10 or 20 or 30 percent of your winnings off your table at a high-enough price and putting it back into your portfolio will almost always help you sleep better. . The third, and most common way, an angel makes their money is when a startup is bought. There are three types of M&amp;A (merger and acquisition) deals: acquihires (a.k.a. fire sales), appropriate acquisitions, and premium sales. The term “acquihire” is a combination of “acquisition” and “hire,” and it’s what you call it when a big company buys a smaller company only to hire the entire team without doing a complete end run around the investors. When a startup gets acquihired, shareholders are likely to get back just pennies for every dollar they invested. . Chapter 31: 天使投资策略 . Remember, we have more blind spots than we do clear vision, so you must unlearn what you have learned to be a successful angel. . Some angels bet on founders. Some angels want to solve a problem. Some angels bet on delight. Some angels bet on markets. . Chapter 32：和成功者同行and do the work . Soak in what you’ve learned by hitting a home run in your first thirty bets while appreciating the randomness of life. You “didn’t exactly hit the lottery, but you did get lucky because your thirty bets probably weren’t all that different from the bets of people who lost money or broke even. In fact, almost all angels probably have a very similar return profile if you take out their top investment—and the exact same return profile if you take out their top three hits. . Life is random, but luck isn’t. Lucky people surround themselves with the most successful people in the world “and take chances. It isn’t hard or impossible. It just takes work. Do the work. Trust me, just do the work. .",

They also help you refine your selection ability in the future by reading your past deal memos to see what you got right and wrong. . Deal memo: Introduction, Deal, Competition, Hiring Plan, Key Risks, and a Recommendation. . Chapter 23: 不是不投，时候未到 . I would offer to let founders “take the red pill or blue pill” after they pitched me. In 100 percent of the cases, they took the red pill and asked me to tell them the unvarnished truth. I would then explain to them, founder to founder, exactly what I thought of their business, their product, and their pitch, plus how other investors would react to it. . These days, I am most likely to tell founders “not yet” when they ask me if I’m ready to invest. It’s an elegant phrase that Roelof Botha taught me and it works like a charm. In addition to telling them that I’m just not there yet, I let them know that I’d like for them to add me to their monthly updates. . Chapter 24: 天使投资的尽职调查 . Due diligence in early-stage investing is the voluntary act of looking into a business or individual before giving them your money. . Groupthink or perhaps even delusional thinking also tends to set in during investing, with people looking around the bargaining table at each other and thinking, “If nothing is scaring off those other three successful investors, then I’m not worried, either. I’m sure if something was wrong, one of them would have uncovered it. . During your founder meetings, you drill into a number of factual questions, getting more specific as you go. . People lie, to themselves and their investors and the world, but there is a difference between a factual lie (“We have Facebook and Google under contract!”) and a lofty mission (a.k.a. delusion) that if everything goes right, it just might turn into reality, like “We’re going to get to Mars” or “People lie, to themselves and their investors and the world, but there is a difference between a factual lie (“We have Facebook and Google under contract!”) and a lofty mission (a.k.a. delusion) that if everything goes right, it just might turn into reality, like “We’re going to get to Mars” or “We’re going to index the world’s information.” . Chapter 25: 第一次说“Yes” . You’re going to want to have a solid startup attorney review these documents for you, giving you a brief summary of the deal and calling out anything they feel is unusual. It will take an hour at most for an attorney to summarize a deal for you, and it’s well worth the cost. You should double-check that you have pro rata (see chapter 21). If it’s not in there, simply ask the founder to add it for you. They will almost universally do this without much fuss. . You should try to get a copy of the cap table if they’re willing to give it, as this gives you a very clear picture of who was involved in the round and how many shares each person owns. Over time, you’ll become good at reading these cap tables and decoding the investing strategies of other angel investors and venture capitalists. . Chapter 26: 创始人对待天使的态度 . Angels need you to crush it in order to have any chance of getting their money back and they will be your biggest cheerleaders. They love you and want you to succeed, so you shouldn’t hide from them or bend reality to what you think they want to hear. Be honest with us so we can help. . Additionally, remember that 80 or 90 percent of our investments fail, and we have to suffer through shutdown after shutdown. It’s depressing for us, especially in years two, three, and four of angel investing. . Send us monthly updates. Or twice a month. Fuck it, send a short weekly update if it’s concise—we want to help and we can’t help you if we aren’t up to speed. . First, as an angel, you need to document and fight for your rights. “Second, as the founder of a company, you should be on high alert when a new investor or an acquirer wants you to screw your earlier investors. If someone is willing to screw your early supporters, who helped you get to where you are today, what do you think they will do when your relationship hits a bump in the road? Exactly. .",

What secrets do you know that will help you beat both the incumbents and your fast followers?) Sometimes, founders will not have an answer for this question. And that’s okay. This is one you often end up answering while looking in the rearview mirror. | Chapter 19: 战术性问题 . Tell me about the competition. | How do you make money? | How much do you charge customers? | How much does your average customer spend? | Tell me the top three reasons why this business might fail. | Example answers for AirBnb might be: . Hotels and HomeAway are our two biggest competitors. Hotels and HomeAway are both much more expensive—typically two to three times more expensive—than an Airbnb. | We take a transaction fee. | We take 3 percent from the host and charge a 10 percent fee from the guest. | Our average stay is 1.7 nights, with a total charge of $225, of which we keep about $40. | Regulations are our biggest challenge, finding inventory is our second-biggest challenge, and having a consistent, high-quality experience is our third-biggest challenge. | Chapter 20: 放弃是最常见创业失败的原因 . The number one reason a startup shuts down is not actually running out of money, which is what most people believe. The number one reason a startup fails is that the founder gives up. . Chapter 21: 投资已经有产品的公司与估值 . When you’re evaluating deals at the earliest stages of a startup’s life, there is not a lot of data to go on. You can put angel investing into two basic buckets: pre-traction and post-traction. . Pre-traction means the product doesn’t have users or revenue. In the pre-traction bucket, you will hear investors discuss startups in various phases of progress including, roughly from early to later: back of the napkin, basic research, business plan, mock-ups, functional prototype, MVP (minimum viable product), beta testing, and stealth mode. . Simply put, there are enough companies that have product/market fit, some traction, and some angel investors but need more capital to finish their mission. “Those are the startups you need to focus on with these first thirty angel investments. You want the people who are doing it, not the people talking about maybe doing it after you fund them. . Another great technique is to simply ask the founder, “Is that valuation set in stone?” and just listen. Perhaps they, like countless startups in the past, will come back to you in a couple of weeks, after their round didn’t materialize, and have a different number in mind. This is a marketplace and valuations can go up and down, but valuations are not as important as understanding who the other investors are, how the business is doing, who the customers are, and who’s on the team. .",

People want to meet with people who are fascinated by their vision, so take a moment to state why you think their vision is important and how you think you can help them achieve it—because they might just hit reply and introduce you to the founder. .

            "content": "Chapter 11: 天使联合会 (Angel Syndicate) . At these sites, successful angel investors create an investment group, or syndicate, where they explain what they typically invest in, what they’ve already invested in (their track record), how much they typically invest per deal (typically $10,000 to $100,000), and how much in “carry” they will charge you on a successful exit. Carry is short for “carried interest,” and it’s defined as the share of profits that go to the fund manager—in this case called the syndicate lead. . On these platforms, the syndicate leads typically take a 15 percent carry and the platform itself takes another 5 percent, for a total of a 20 percent carry. This is exactly how venture capital firms charge their own investors, who are called limited partners (LPs), with one critical difference: fees. . With angel syndicates, you simply pay the carry. There are no fees other than some minor legal and filing fees (typically less than $10,000 per deal, spread out across the dozens of investors in a deal). Individual angels like you can sign up for a syndicate (like mine) and make a nonbinding pledge to invest a small dollar amount per deal. On my syndicate, the minimum is $1,000, but most syndicates set this number at $2,500 to weed out the more casual investors. When a syndicate lead shares a deal, each of the syndicate members gets a chance to evaluate the deal via an online profile for that startup that typically includes a pitch deck and why the syndicate lead is investing. A syndicate normally negotiates an allocation with the founder of the startup, typically $200,000 to $500,000 (or 10 to 50 percent of a seed round). If the syndicate can pull together enough investment interest, the deal is consummated. That’s why I advocate that new angels do ten small angel syndicates before they start doing direct investing. Beyond the very real chance of getting a positive return on your investment, if you do this hack, you will build your reputation, have a chance to prove your worth to founders, and jump-start your network—all for the bargain price of $25,000. That’s only 20 percent of the cost of an MBA and you can do it in a month! . Syndicates require very little paperwork and you can choose to invest without taking any meetings or doing any due diligence. The only thing you need be able to do is prove that you’re an accredited investor here in the United States and have your wire transfer clear. . Chapter 12: 天使联合会基础 . I suggest looking for these basic characteristics: . A syndicate lead who has been investing for at least five years and has at least one notable, unicorn investment | A startup that is based in Silicon Valley | A startup that has at least two founders (with two, you have a backup in case one quits) | A startup that has a product or service that is already in the market (you’re not qualified to invest in startups that haven’t released their products—and frankly you don’t need to take this risk) | A startup that has either (a) six months of continuous user growth or (b) six months of revenue | A startup that has notable investors | A startup that, post-funding, will have eighteen months of cash remaining, commonly referred to as runway (ask the founder and syndicate lead how many months of runway they will have post-funding) | . If you love taking risks and don’t mind being locked up for a decade, I could see you putting 10 to 20 percent of your bankroll into angel investing. If you can tolerate risk, but don’t love it, and you can handle being illiquid for a decade, I could see you putting 5 percent of your bankroll into angel investing. If you’re going to be a great angel investor, start at the small tables while you learn—there is no rush. Every year, billion-dollar companies are created, and that will continue for the rest of our lives . For all ten of the startups you select, you need to write a “deal memo” explaining why you’re investing, what you think the risks are, and what you think has to go right for the startup to return money on your investment. . Syndicates are your Dagobah, a place where you can learn from other angel masters without losing a limb or your head. Go ahead and ask the syndicate lead why they are investing, meet with the founders, and talk to their customers—learn how to hold a lightsaber without cutting your fingers off. .",

            "content": "Chapter 1: 技术进步无可避免 . But I don’t invest in this future because I want to sit in an ivory tower laughing at people whose jobs are replaced. I invest in this future because it’s inevitable and I think I can help accelerate the efforts of the founders and innovators who are missionaries, not mercenaries. Of course, I plan to make a great deal of money in these revolutions, but I also plan to look back proudly and know that I helped propel changes that made our planet better. . Chapter 2: 赌一赌单车变摩托 . Now, gambling has a very negative connotation here in the West, but when I would spend all night playing poker in Los Angeles, with mostly old Asian men, I would frequently hear them say “No gamble, no future,” before pushing their chips into the pot, standing up, and rubbing their necks and heads furiously (a tic I soon acquired unconsciously). . Chapter 3: 天使投资101 . Angel investing is the act of putting money into the earliest investment rounds of a private business with the goal of getting back more money than you put in—much more than you can return in a safer, more established investment vehicle. . Chapter 4: 天使的四种能力 . The best angels in the world have four qualities, giving them the ability to (1) write a check (money), (2) jam out with the founders over important issues (time), (3) provide meaningful customer and investor introductions (network), and (4) give actionable advice that saves the founders time and money—or keeps them from making mistakes (expertise). . Chapter 5: 在硅谷投资 . Yes! . Chapter 6: 网络效应 . We live in a world full of network effects. The nodes in the network here in the Bay Area are the investors (angels, incubators, and venture capitalists), founders, service providers (colleges, lawyers, headhunters, and banks), and the talent pool (developers, designers, and marketers). . Chapter 7: 投资阶段 . sweat equity: It’s not an official round of funding. It’s the original creation of the business, and, unlike an investment round, the ownership here is paid for with the founders’ own sweat. | bootstrapping: A company with sweat equity has built its product or service based on the talents of its team, but a bootstrapped company might have had some outside help—but not from investors. For example, many times the founder of a startup will find a client who is willing to pay for a product that they built with sweat equity. | Friends and Family | Self-funding: When I meet someone who is going into debt to self-fund their startup I get worried—especially if they have a family. In my mind, if you have a family to take care of and you put them at risk to pursue a startup that you can’t build with sweat equity, bootstrapping, using your friends’ and family’s money, or raising money from a professional investor, you are, in all likelihood, insane. | Incubator funding: Most incubators will give founders $25,000 to $150,000 in seed funding for 5 to 10 percent of their startup. | Seed/Angel Funding: Most founders get their seed round by successfully completing two or three of the five early-stage funding strategies above. Essentially, your job as an angel is to monitor people coming out of these channels and pick out the best ones. | Bridge Round, a.k.a. Seed Plus: This round of funding typically comes from the same investors who did the seed round. Those investors are faced with losing their investment if they don’t continue to fund the startup, so they tend to be motivated to “close the bridge. What has changed since I made my original investment? | Serias A: The Series A is the most coveted and important round for a startup because it is typically done by a professional venture capital firm that will join the board and create proper “governance. Pro rata means you get to keep your percentage ownership in a company. Typically when you angel invest, you don’t get pro rata rights—unless you demand them, and then you do. | Series B, C, D, E, F, and Mezzanine Rounds: In fact, if your angel investment is starting to raise a Series B, C, D, or further rounds of financing, it’s probably time for you to consider selling some part of your stake in what’s called a “secondary” stock sale. | . Chapter 8: 创始人&lt;&gt;天使&lt;&gt;风险投资 . Now, in today’s modern age, I think the first $5 million you make is “take the edge off” money. You now have a decade of capital to rest on. However, when you break $10 million you have “escape velocity,” where you will never have to work again. The $500,000 in yearly interest you net should cover your expenses for a lifetime. However, when you get over $20 million, you’re in the “fuck you money” zone, where you can tell anyone to go fuck themselves. It’s a dangerous test of a founder’s resolve in my experience to go from being under the gun to being able to tell anyone who stands in your way to go make you a ham sandwich. VCs really don’t like to have founders get to “escape velocity” or “fuck you money”. . For angels, secondary shares are a wise way to “dollar cost average” your returns. If you have a chance to sell 25 percent of your position once or twice before the IPO, it would be wise to do so because we’ve all seen companies worth billions go to zero many, many, many times. . Being a founder is amazing because you get to build what you want to see in the world and you’re the “god-king/queen” at your company, but the odds are wildly against founders making a huge return, while the odds are in favor of a lifelong angel or venture capitalist getting rich. . Chapter 9: 机会成本 . How to allocate your finite time and energy efficiently is something you constantly have to revisit as an investor, founder, parent, and human being. The cost of not revisiting your allocation of time is great, leading to massive regret at having spent too much time on a startup, marriage, friendship, or investment that is destined to disappoint you or destroy your soul. . Chapter 10: 让自己幸运的方法 . It’s time for you to unplug from the Matrix and realize that you don’t need to pretend you’re rich by getting the premium channel package, and actually get rich by taking intelligent risks. . Even if the investments had failed, even if people had laughed at me calling myself an angel, even though I was only investing $500 at a time, I would have learned a heck of a lot and met a ton of entrepreneurial people. You can make your own luck in this life by putting yourself next to the people who are already winning. .",

This reminds me of my recent impulse of taking over some implementation work from others in order to speed things up. Actually, I shouldn’t do that due to the following reasons: . To be an IC6, it’s expected to design and/or implement the hardest parts of the system. The implementation I took over is actually not “the hardest part” of the project. | I usurpped my colleagues role of practicing the implementation who are commited to implement the most of API level functionalities. | There is other way to speed up the project. For example, I can take time to triage the issue to tell if it’s lack of competence or commitment from them. My feeling is the latter of lacking of commitment/motivation. Then, I should talk to them formally about my expectation, project timeline and see if they were occupied by other commitments. As the result, we should come up with the new target date for code completion and individual’s commitment e.g. how much time they will invest in this project. All above is better than me taking over some implementation work which falls back to my old style of doing most of things myself. | . I noticed this and provided the late feedbacks. Hopefully, this will help! . Never Take Their Job Definitions for Granted Relying on assumptions and general job descriptions or following in the footsteps of the person who had the job before them will frequently lead to failure. People need to take the initiative to define jobs for themselves and to define them with specificity. This means not only defining what their contribution should be but also establishing how they will be measured and identifying the differences between their role and those of people above and below them.” .

That can lead us to think again, moving us closer to the truth without damaging our relationships. . 完全追求没有矛盾，不是和谐，而是冷漠。它说明不不关心问题，不关心问题中的其他相关方。这其实是在日常工作中挺常见的，往往一个会议如果有超过10个人参加，往往参与度，讨论度都会集中在个别一些人上，其他人会因为各种原因tune out，甚至开始做自己的事。所以我觉得会议的目的是选择参与者的标准，如果一个会议是为了讨论问题，首先要考虑会议是否有必要开(比如是否可以再文档上先协作，再决定是否有必要实时地交流)，会议参与者也是只需要邀请会深度贡献在问题某一个(或几个)方面的人，邀请更多地反而会稀释讨论的深度; 如果会议是其他目的，比如汇报工作，或者传达消息，那自然有另外的流程与要求。 . 对事的矛盾可以演化为事物前进的动力，对人的矛盾往往涉及到情感的攻击而偏离矛盾的本身。团队的领导需要很明确这一点，尤其是对比较年轻不太有经验的成员，或是明显感觉到对人有攻击性的成员，需要单独说明对事不对人的原因，自己的标准。在刚工作的前两年，自己在这方面也做的不好，有时候会觉得为啥一个人那么讨厌，其实对方可能针对我完成的代码或是设计，而不是对我本人有意见。 .",

            "content": "I’ve noticed a paradox in great scientists and superforecasters: the reason they’re so comfortable being wrong is that they’re terrified of being wrong. What sets them apart is the time horizon. They’re determined to reach the correct answer in the long run, and they know that means they have to be open to stumbling, backtracking, and rerouting in the short run. . 这就像学生时代，作业的错误是为了避免小考的错误，小考的错误是为了避免期末考的错误，期末考的错误是为了避免升学考试的错误。在不同规模上”试错，犯错，反思，迭代，进步”，控制犯错的成本和时机。当然这个在一个组织中很取决于组织的文化，是否有心理上的安全感，可以让大家看到你犯的错误，通过别人的错误来反思。这个后面的分享会提到。 . Yes, we’re entitled to hold opinions inside our own heads. If we choose to express them out louad, though, I think it’s our responsibility to ground them in logic and facts, share our reasoning with others, and change our minds when better evidence emerges. . 我们都有权利拥有自己的想法。但想要表达出来的时候，要考虑自己的想法是否成熟，理由或是数据是否能支持你的想法，有没有想过对立的想法。想法谁都可以有，但受过压力测试的想法，有事实支撑和逻辑严密的想法往往才是有分享价值的。往往越有智慧的人，越不轻意分享自己的想法，哪怕这些想法在一般人看来已经可以奉为圭臬。其次一个想法本身是有时空局限性的，100年前的好想法，现在看来可能很蠢。在听到很有道理的想法时，要看它的使用范围和条件在你面对的条件下是否满足，在分享自己的想法时，要加上语境和限制条件，在新的条件出现时，进一步调整成熟的想法。 .",

The above two pokemon are quite similar to each other. From wiki) . it esolves from Mankey starting at level 28. . Let&#39;s take a look at another confusion pair:(&#39;Ponyta&#39;, &#39;Rapidash&#39;, 4) . Image.open((path/&quot;Ponyta&quot;).ls()[0]) . Image.open((path/&quot;Rapidash&quot;).ls()[0]) . It&#39;s another pair of evolution.From wiki) . It evolves from Ponyta starting at level 40 . Let&#39;s fine tune our model . First step, pick a more deeper model resnet34 and find a optimal learning rate . resnet34_learn = cnn_learner(dls, resnet34, metrics=error_rate) lr_min,lr_steep = resnet34_learn.lr_find() . Print out lr_min / 10, and lr_steep . print(f&quot;Minimum/10: {lr_min:.2e}, steepest point: {lr_steep:.2e}&quot;) . Minimum/10: 1.20e-02, steepest point: 1.10e-02 . In the learning rate plot, it appers that a learning rate around 1e-2 would be approriate, so let&#39;s choose that . lr=1e-2 . Second step, use the lr and manually train the last layer for several epochs (3). . resnet34_learn = cnn_learner(dls, resnet34, metrics=error_rate) resnet34_learn.fit_one_cycle(3, lr) . epoch train_loss valid_loss error_rate time . 0 | 2.437599 | 0.898877 | 0.222874 | 00:29 | . 1 | 1.162741 | 0.594926 | 0.159824 | 00:29 | . 2 | 0.522703 | 0.386840 | 0.096774 | 00:29 | . Then, we unfreeze the model so that we can train all the layers (including all pretrained layers by ImageNet dataset.

            "title": "Thoughts on Ethics for Data Science",
            "content": "Recently, I am taking a online deep learning course on fast.ai. The lesson 3 of the course is focusing on data ethics. The lecturer, Rachel Thomas, touches a few points that I echo back. Around 1:52:50, there is a short discussion . Q: Maybe the best way to incentivize ethical behavior it to tie financial or reputational risk to good behavior. In some ways, similar to how companies are now investing in cybersecurity because they don’t want to be the next Equifax. Can grassroots compaigns help in better ethical behaviors with regards to the use of AI? Rachel Thomas: …I think it’s hard for people to make the case to their boses of why they should be investing in cybersecurity. Particularly because cybersecurity is something that when it’s working well, you don’t notice it. … . Lots of things like cybersecurity that people are lacking of incentives/motivation to make an investment before something really bad happens to themselves. My personal experience is when designing a product (or running a service), many companies are eager to launch their product/service as early as possible with little test, and they call it “test it in production; move fast; quicker iteration beats fine-tuning”. In some cases, it will only lead to acceptable level of bad user experience while in others it could be devastating and turns out completely shutting down the business. Is there a good strategy to invest early before everything is to late? As mentioned above, it’s really hard to make the case unless it’s tied to financial/reputational risk, which is more close to a postmortem analysis after something bad happens. It’s easier to start this effort if the leadership team pocesses such mindset of prioritizing quality, privacy, security traits of their product/service, and building a culture around them. . Another point that hits me is around 2:05:52. I found the full version of interview and will quote here. . WHAT’S WRONG WITH AI Julia Angwn: I strongly believe that in order to solve a problem, you have to diagnose it, and that we’re still in the diagnosis phase of this. If you think about the turn of the century and industrialization, we had, I don’t know, 30 years of child labor, unlimited work hours, terrible working conditions, and it took a lot of journalist muckraking and advocacy to diagnose the problem and have some understanding of what it was, and then the activism to get laws changed. I feel like we’re in a second industrialization of data information. I think some call it the second machine age. We’re in the phase of just waking up from the heady excitement and euphoria of having access to technology at our fingertips at all times. That’s really been our last 20 years, that euphoria, and now we’re like, “Whoa, looks like there’re some downsides.” I see my role as trying to make as clear as possible what the downsides are, and diagnosing them really accurately so that they can be solvable. That’s hard work, and lots more people need to be doing it. It’s increasingly becoming a field, but I don’t think we’re all the way there. . Dianosing and understanding the full picture of the problem is not an easy problem. It takes non-trivial time to identify the exact problem and serves as the starting point of crafting potential solution. On the one hand, if we don’t fully understand the problem, it may cost way more time and resource to pivot. On the other hand, we can’t spend endless time on diagnosing a problem, it’s not pratical in reality and we never make any progress to exercise some potential solutions to test our understanding. It’s always a evolving and dynamic process that we put enough time ahead to understand the problem, then design solution and test it, measure the results to create a feedback loop to adjust the initial understanding and design a better solution. .",

And it is naturally self-correcting as a whole, though not necessarily for its parts. For example, if there is too much supply and waste in a market, prices will go down, companies will go out of business, and capacity will be reduced until the supply falls in line with the demand, at which time the cycle will start to move in the opposite direction. Similarly, if an economy turns bad enough, those responsible for running it will make the political and policy changes that are needed or they will not survive, making room for their replacements to come along. These cycles are continuous and play out in logical ways and they tend to be self-reinforcing. . I believe that every entity needs to focus on evolving (or they will die out), making connection with the world while consuming input from it and producing output to it. It’s similar to a dot on a huge net, without connecting to other dots, it’s a an island, it never grows or influences other dots. . Why blogging .

            "content": "The following are quoted from a fast.ai notebook (04_mnist_basics) discussing Tenacity and Deep Learning. I want to share some reflection on this “touching” anecdote. . The story of deep learning is one of tenacity and grit by a handful of dedicated researchers. After early hopes (and hype!) neural networks went out of favor in the 1990’s and 2000’s, and just a handful of researchers kept trying to make them work well. Three of them, Yann Lecun, Yoshua Bengio, and Geoffrey Hinton, were awarded the highest honor in computer science, the Turing Award (generally considered the “Nobel Prize of computer science”), in 2018 after triumphing despite the deep skepticism and disinterest of the wider machine learning and statistics community. Geoff Hinton has told of how even academic papers showing dramatically better results than anything previously published would be rejected by top journals and conferences, just because they used a neural network. Yann Lecun’s work on convolutional neural networks, which we will study in the next section, showed that these models could read handwritten text—something that had never been achieved before. However, his breakthrough was ignored by most researchers, even as it was used commercially to read 10% of the checks in the US! In addition to these three Turing Award winners, there are many other researchers who have battled to get us to where we are today. For instance, Jurgen Schmidhuber (who many believe should have shared in the Turing Award) pioneered many important ideas, including working with his student Sepp Hochreiter on the long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture (widely used for speech recognition and other text modeling tasks, and used in the IMDb example in «chapter_intro»). Perhaps most important of all, Paul Werbos in 1974 invented back-propagation for neural networks, the technique shown in this chapter and used universally for training neural networks (Werbos 1994). His development was almost entirely ignored for decades, but today it is considered the most important foundation of modern AI. There is a lesson here for all of us! On your deep learning journey you will face many obstacles, both technical, and (even more difficult) posed by people around you who don’t believe you’ll be successful. There’s one guaranteed way to fail, and that’s to stop trying. We’ve seen that the only consistent trait amongst every fast.ai student that’s gone on to be a world-class practitioner is that they are all very tenacious. . It’s indeed a great story about tenacity and grit. I ask myself: If most of my peers were standing on the other side, could I still firmly hold on to my position and prove their validness? Unfortunately, I can’t give a postive answer. People are mostly social animal, we need to be supported, loved and believed by our peers. Otherwise, our lives are in a danger if abandoned by our “tribe”. Taking the alternative path and be the minorities needs tremendous courage and belief that the truth rests on their side. I don’t think it’s always worthing the correctness our beliefs and/or ideas and win the battle of argument every time. For example, when you and your partner have different opinions, there is no need to convince them you are the right one. If your parner is reasonable person or the issue may lead to consequences you can’t bear, then the strategies to reach the agreement are another story. . Another point is as a learner of deep learning, we should catiously pace of our learning, not too fast and not too slow. If we go through all the material too fast, we pay less attention on the key components which may backfire when we try to go deeper into the area. Building a solid foundation, especially learning stuff you have no exposure before, is a smart strategy in order to go fast in the future. If we move too slow, we may lose interests because we are making enough progress to get feedbacks. For example, if I spend a whole month figuring out every nitty gritty details of math and library details of fast.ai, I won’t feel any excitement and may eventually drop the class. The course structure is well designed by fast.ai team adopting a top-down approach to grasp the whole picture of deep learning, train some state-of-the-art models solving real life problem in lession 1 &amp; 2 and intentionally leave out math and other coding details. .",

            "content": "This is mostly inspired by a fast.ai MOOC: Practical Deep Learning for Coders.It used a top-down approach teaching the deep learning. Lesson 1 and 2 will directly build several the state of the art deep learning models by a few lines of code. . In this notebook, my goal is to train a model to tell the difference of my cat: Albus, a silver shaded british shorthair from all other british short hairs. There is little pratical utility of the model, though it can be extended to something like pet finder using cameras including CCTVs, phone&#39;s camera etc to help people find their missing pet. . As a reader, you just need some basic understanding of python (or similar) and really limited experience of coding such as variable assignment, import libraries, calling some functions. I will explain every step in this notebook of what it&#39;s achieving. . Import your libraries . This is some basic python code import fastai/fastbook libraries (built by fast.ai team) to your jupyter notebook so that you can use all classes, functions in the libraries. One thing you might notice, it&#39;s generally a bad habit to import *, but according to fast.ai mooc, they pay extra attention on this, and it only imports necessary artifacts into the notebook, so you don&#39;t have to worry to much about it. . from fastbook import * from fastai.vision.widgets import * . Prepare your data . In this step, it will prepare your training data. . For my pet Albus, I upload around 150 pictures into a folder british_shorthair/albus. | For the not_albus part, I use bing image search API to find around 150 silver shaded british shorthair images and download them into british_shorthair/albus.

Train your model . In the following code cell, it only contains 4 lines of code but it does quite a lot: . Line 1: It prepares your data for training your model. It returns a DataBlock which is a fast.ai class blocks=(ImageBlock, CategoryBlock): It tells datablock that the input data is image and label is category | get_items=get_image_files: it means when loading input item, it will use get_image_files function to load the data | splitter=RandomSplitter(valid_pct=0.2, seed=42): it means that a randomation split will be performed to split your data into training (80%) and validation (20%). Seed will guarantee everytime it does a separation, the result will be the same. | get_y=parent_label: it teams when load label, it will find the image&#39;s parent folder name as the label name, which is a common way to organize the data | item_tfms=RandomResizedCrop(224, min_scale=0.5): It applies item-wise transformation, which randomly resize and crop you image with size 224 px and minimum 50% of original image. | batch_tfms=aug_transforms(): It&#39;s using image augmentation technics to transform batch of images. It will flip, twist, adjust different stats of your images to generate &quot;new&quot; images for training purpose so that model can learn from different perspectives. | | Line 2: It loads the actual data from your path | Line 3: We use a cnn learner with our data, and resnet18 architecture and use error rate as our metrics. The architecture in our case is not supper important and it&#39;s a deep residual network pretrained on imagenet (more on https://pytorch.org/hub/pytorch_vision_resnet/). For error rate, you will see that at each epoch (iteration) of training, what percentage of images that model makes mistake predict the correct label on validation set. | Line 4: it uses transfer learning technics and you don&#39;t need to train the model from scatch. Instead, you just need to call fine tune for 4 epochs on your training data which saves us a lot of time and reduces the requirements on the number of images we need to train a good model. | # Using transfer learning tactic since I don&#39;t have enough albus picture to train british_sh = DataBlock( blocks=(ImageBlock, CategoryBlock), get_items=get_image_files, splitter=RandomSplitter(valid_pct=0.2, seed=42), get_y=parent_label, item_tfms=RandomResizedCrop(224, min_scale=0.5), batch_tfms=aug_transforms() ) dls = british_sh.dataloaders(silver_british_shorthair_path) learn = cnn_learner(dls, resnet18, metrics=error_rate) learn.fine_tune(4) . epoch train_loss valid_loss error_rate time . 0 | 1.217437 | 3.258252 | 0.425926 | 00:18 | . epoch train_loss valid_loss error_rate time . 0 | 0.540694 | 1.086071 | 0.388889 | 00:19 | . 1 | 0.425827 | 0.172585 | 0.055556 | 00:18 | . 2 | 0.306371 | 0.045891 | 0.037037 | 00:18 | . 3 | 0.277176 | 0.029750 | 0.000000 | 00:19 | .

This step is not necessary if you don&#39;t want to use your model anywhere else. However, if you do, exporting your model to the pickle format and loading it at somewhere else e.g. your web server, mobile app is really easy way to use your model. . learn.export(&#39;albus-detector.pkl&#39;) . Make predictions . I prepare some test data (which model never sees in training as well as in validation sets) to see if model can actually predict on those images.

            "content": "There are six leadership passages that a leader needs to go through. The book focuses on helping readers become familiar with the skills, time applications, and work values demanded by each passage, as well as this particular leadership gestalt. . Passage One: From Managing Self to Managing Others . Manageing self: They contribute by doing the assigned work within given time frames and in ways that meet objectives. By sharpening and boardening their individual skills, they make increased contributions and are then considered “promotable” by organizations. From a time application standpoint, the learning involves planning (so that work is completed on time), punctuality, content, quality, and reliability. The work values to be developed include acceptance of the company culture and adopting of professional standards. | Managing others: The skills people should learn at this first leadership passage include planning work, filling jobs, assigning work, motivating, coaching, and measuring the work of others.They must shift from “doing” work to getting work done through others. They must believe that making time for others, planning, coaching, and the like are necessary tasks and are their responsibility. More than that, they must view this other-directed work as mission-critical to their sucess. Passage Two: From Managing Others to Managing Managers . Perhaps the biggest difference from the previous passage is that here, managers must be pure management. Now they need to divest themselves of individual tasks. The key skills that must be mastered duration this transition include . | Selecting people to turn Passage One | Assigning managerial and leadership work to them | Measuring their progress as managers | Coaching them | Beginning to think beyond their function and concerning themselves with strategic issues that support the overall business One of the touch responsibility of managers of managers is to return people to individual-contributor roles if first-line managers don’t shift their behaviors and values Passage Three: From Managing Managers to Functional Manager . | Skills: New communication skills with individual contributors | Endeavor to understand areas that are outside their own experiences and also learn to value it | Team play with other functional managers and competition for resources based on business needs | Proficient strategiest, not only for their function but also for blending their functional strategy with the overall business strategy. | . | Time-application: Participating in business team meetings and working with other functional managers | Delegating responsibility for overseeing many functional tasks to direct reports | . | Value Long-term strategy, such as state-of-the-art, futuristic thinking for their function, is usually what gives most managers trouble. Passage Four: From Functional Manager to Business Manager . | . | Receive significant autonomy | In charge of integrating functions | From looking at plans and proposals functionally to a profit perspective and to a long-term view | Balancing act between future goals and present needs and making trade-offs between the two Passage Five: From Business Manager to Group Manager . | Similar managing self to managing others, a business manager values the success of his own business while a group manager values the success of other people’s businesses. | Evaluating strategy for resource allocation and deployment purposes. | Development of business managers | Portfolio strategy: Do I have the right collection of businesses? What to add, subtract and change? | Avoid wishful thinking and instead taking a hard, objective looking at their range of resources and making a judment based on analysis and experience. Passage Six: From Group Manager to Enterprise Manager . | Long term visionary thinkers | Develop operating mechanisms to know and drive quarter-by-quarter performance that is in tune with longer-term strategy. | Well-developed external sensitivity and the ability to manage external constituencies, sense significant external shifts, and do something about them proactively. | Let go of the pieces - that is, the individual products and customers - and focus on the whole | Assume a team of high-achieving and ambitious direct reports. | .",

            "content": "吃老本 . 前一篇聊了成为技术管理者后，不免会在技术上有所退步，我们首先要接受这个事实。那接受后是不是就可以安心地吃老本呢，当然不是。在现金这个社会，只需要一两年，甚至更短的时间内技术就会迭代，一年前火热的框架，可能在今年就会被另一套技术或是框架所替代。作为技术管理者，除非你在成为技术管理者前已经有大量的沉淀，对各种技术融汇贯通，否则老本真没几年好吃。 . Why/How/What . 那既然技术迭代得那么快，而管理者又不可能完全专注于技术上，那么就要着眼于顶层的架构，能够对自己领域内的系统的不同设计回答why, how和what。why其实是最重要的，核心是回答一个系统服务于解决一个什么现实中的问题，就比如消息队列是一种服务间的异步通讯方式，主要解决不需要同步（即时性）的操作的请求和应答。how是回答为了实现这个功能，从meta层面如何设计这个系统，这儿有一个比较好用的判断标准，你能不能在10分钟（甚至5分钟）就把这个系统的设计思路给一个有一定技术背景但没有结束过你的系统的人讲清楚系统是怎么运作的，并谈谈其关键指标，不同设计的优劣与分别适用于怎么样的场景、需求。这儿还是以消息队列来举例，最经典的kafka的模型，producer -&gt; broker/queue -&gt; consumer，一个或多个producer发送消息到broker的某个topic，一个或多个consumer可以订阅broker的topic来获得更新，这就是最基础的how。what注重于细节设计，注重一个系统里每个子系统的设计与实现，了解的深度可以更加因地制宜，但一些关键点还是需要知道的。比如消息队列中broker的persistent策略，consumer如何确保不会漏消系，遇到重复的消息应该怎么处理等等。 . Priority . 一个技术型公司当技术团队超过50人后一线技术管理者需要更了解how和what，而更高层级的管理者的应该更偏重why和how，放手what。这儿举个WhatsApp的例子，当WhatsApp在被FB收购前还只有10~30人左右的工程师团队时，每个人都非常hands on，也没有什么一线技术管理，只有工程师，一个工程师负责一大块的功能。当被收购后慢慢团队到了50-100人，就开始出现技术管理，这个阶段没有太多的层级，所以每个manager其实也还是输出一定代码的。后期发展到几百人的团队，不同的国家都有团队时，一线manager就不会再输出太多代码了（偶尔会有一些，因人而异），而senior manager及以上更多地就会注重why，how并且challenge手下一些what的问题，来获得二手的信息。 .",

            "content": "保持技术敏感度：为什么想要分享这个话题 . 想做成一个系列的分享，第一篇就写写为什么会想要分享这个话题。 管理者不是天生就是在管理的位置上，都会经过一份或者几分技术类的工作 (当然这里说的技术适用于很多领域比如市场，产品，销售等等，不仅仅是计算机相关的技术。当然因为我本身是做IT的，所以会以IT技术为例做分享)，最终成为一个管理者的。当然第一份工作就是创业的话会有一些些的不同，但即使你是创始人之一，也是同时在做技术类和管理类的工作。当一个人成为了管理者后，就会面对一个问题，你的主要职责是支持你的团队，以团队为你的最高优先级做出成绩。很多新的管理者，之前有着很出色的技术，会习惯于还在一线干活，或者还非常深入的参加技术层面的设计。很多国内的公司对于一线管理者的要求也是即负责技术也负责管理。这就对一线管理者提出了更高的要求，你既要懂技术，也要能带团队。一个人的时间是有限的，你不可能还像原先一样团身心的投入在技术层面，那怎么样能够保持技术能力、敏感度，又不耽误管理的任务呢。 在第一篇的最后，说一个Google/Facebook在管理者上的一个演变，当Google、Facebook还相对较小时，有一种Technical Lead Manager (TLM) 的职位，就是像上面所提到的你既要负责技术方向，也要带团队，甚至偶尔还要撸起袖子写代码(当团队处于紧急状态时)。而当公司渐渐成长了之后TLM越来越稀少，公司也越来越不鼓励成为TLM，TLM的职位被拆分成了Engineering Mangager (EM)和Tech Lead (TL, IC5+ engineer)，EM和TL往往要合作，一个偏重于团队，一个偏重于技术，但TL也要动一些管理，EM也要能理解现有技术，趋势和评价可行性等(可以不懂一些细节)。我认为一方面是公司大了，自然分工会更明确，在单方面集中精力自然会做的比同事兼顾多方面来的更好，但对于EM来说，尤其是空降的EM，会对技术方面也有要求，而往往管理的技术可以通用，但是技术不一定通用，如何快速了解团队的技术就成了一个大问题。 .",

            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) .

            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code .

My interests lay in technology (e.g. DL, distributed system), leadership/management, self-improvement (both physically and mentally), investment (I am a believer of index investing). I also picked some topics that are not usually shown in my book list like philosophy, history. I also enjoy playing games. My favorite games are no limit texas hold’em, kingdom rush, and Zelda breath of the wild. For the kingdom rush one, I used to run my bilibili channel, and if you also enjoy this game, check it out! .",
