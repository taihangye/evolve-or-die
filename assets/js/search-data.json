            "content": "Think of it this way: There are only goods and services. Financial assets are claims on them. In other words, holders of investments/assets (i.e., capitalists-investors) believe that they can convert their holdings into purchasing power to get goods and services. At the same time, workers expect to be able to exchange a unit’s worth of their contribution to the production of goods and services into buying power for goods and services. But since debt/money/ currency have no intrinsic value, the claims on them are greater than the value of what they are supposed to be able to buy, so they have to be devalued or restructured. In other words, when there are too many debt liabilities/ assets, they either have to be reduced via debt restructurings or monetized. Policy makers tend to use monetization at this stage primarily because it is stimulative rather than contractionary. But monetization simply swaps one IOU (debt) for another (newly printed money). The situation is analogous to a Ponzi scheme. Since there aren’t enough goods and services likely to be produced to back up all the IOUs, there’s a worry that people may not be willing to work in return for IOUs forever. . 当金融资产不能被足够的实体资产支撑，那人们就不愿意为了一个虚无的承诺: 金融资产可以兑换成good and service而工作。美国现在就处于这种情况。美联储印钱，股市欣欣向荣，但实体经济不行，失业率一直降不下来，通胀上升，形成滞涨。当降低利率，QE都不管用的时候，就要用到Monetary policy 3. . Low interest rates together with low premiums on risky assets pose a structural challenge for monetary policy. With Monetary Policy 1 (interest rates) and Monetary Policy 2 (QE) at their limits, the central bank has very little ability to provide stimulus through these two channels—i.e., monetary policy has little “gas in the tank.” This typically happens in the later years of the long-term debt cycle (e.g., 1937-38 and now in the US), which can lead to “pushing on a string.” When this happens, policy makers need to look beyond QE to the new forms of monetary and fiscal policy characterized by Monetary Policy 3 . 感觉现在的美国就是在同一历史时期。 . Monetary Policy 3 Monetary Policy 3 puts money more directly into the hands of spenders instead of investors/savers and incentivizes them to spend it. Because wealthy people have fewer incentives to spend the incremental money and credit they get than less wealthy people, when the wealth gap is large and the economy is weak, directing spending opportunities at less wealthy people is more productive. Logic and history show us that there is a continuum of actions to stimulate spending that have varying degrees of control to them. At one end are coordinated fiscal and monetary actions, in which fiscal policy makers provide stimulus directly through government spending or indirectly by providing incentives for nongovernment entities to spend. At the other end, the central bank can provide “helicopter money” by sending cash directly to citizens without coordination with fiscal policy makers. Typically, though not always, there is a coordination of monetary policy and fiscal policy in a way that creates incentives for people to spend on goods and services. Central banks can also exert influence through macroprudential policies that help to shape things in ways that are similar to how fiscal policies might. For simplicity, I have organized that continuum and provided references to specific priorcases of each below. . An increase in debt-financed fiscal spending. Sometimes this is paired with QE that buys most of the new issuance (e.g., in Japan in the 1930s, US during World War II, US and UK in the 2000s). | Increase in debt-financed fiscal spending, where the Treasury isn’t on the hook for the debt, because: The central bank can print money to cover debt payments (e.g., Germany in the 1930s). The central bank can lend to entities other than the government that will use it for stimulus projects(e.g., lending to development banks in China in 2008). | Not bothering to go through issuing debt, and instead giving newly printed money directly to the government to spend. | Printing money and doing direct cash transfers to households (i.e., “helicopter money”). | . policy 3就是直接把钱塞到实体经济手中，鼓励消费，鼓励创造就业，刺激实体经济。这儿财政政策和货币政策往往会配合。 .",

            "content": "Monetary Policy 1 Interest-rate driven monetary policy (which I’ll call Monetary Policy 1) is the most effective because it has the broadest impact on the economy. When central banks reduce interest rates, they stimulate the economy by a) producing a positive wealth effect (because the lower interest rate raises the present value of most investments); b) making it easier to buy items on credit (because the monthly payments decline), raising demand—especially for interest-rate-sensitive items like durable goods and housing; and c) reducing debt-service burdens (which improves cash flows and spending). MP1 is typically the first approach to a debt crisis, but when short-term interest rates hit around 0 percent, it no longer works effectively, so central banks must go to the second type. . 美联储货币政策1，调整利率来影响经济。降低利率刺激经济投资消费，升高利率抑制经济。往往是最常用的手段。但将利率下降到0之后就会失效。 . Monetary Policy 2 “Quantitative easing” (QE) as it is now called (i.e., “printing money” and buying financial assets, typically debt assets), is Monetary Policy 2. It works by affecting the behavior of investors/savers as opposed to borrowers/ spenders, because it is driven by purchases of financial assets, typically debt assets that impact investors/savers the most. When the central bank buys a bond, it gives investors/savers cash, which they typically use to buy another financial asset that they think is more attractive. What they do with that money and credit makes all the difference in the world. When they invest in the sort of assets that finance spending, that stimulates the economy. When they invest in those that don’t (such as financial assets), there must be very large market gains before any money trickles down into spending—and that spending comes more from those who have enjoyed the market gains than from those who haven’t. In other words, QE certainly benefits investors/savers (i.e., those who own financial assets) much more than people who don’t, thus widening the wealth gap. . QE量化宽松，简称印钱。用于购买政府债券以及金融资产。会主要影响投资者和储蓄者，央行给市场提供的资金，各个投资主体会选择另外的资产进行投资，如果被投资的资产是直接影响或者用于消费的那就会刺激经济，否则就比较难以通过消费直接流入实体的经济。这个货币政策是利好于拥有金融资产的主体的，因此会加剧贫富分化。 . While MP2 is generally less effective than interest-rate changes, it is most effective when risk and liquidity premiums are large, because it causes those premiums to fall. When risk premiums are large, and money is added to the system, actual risks are reduced at the same time that there is more money seeking returns, which triggers purchases of riskier assets that are offering higher expected returns, driving their prices up and producing a positive wealth effect. But over time, the use of QE to stimulate the economy declines in effectiveness because risk premiums are pushed down and asset prices are pushed up to levels beyond which they are difficult to push further, and the wealth effect diminishes. In other words, at higher prices and lower expected returns, the compensation for taking risk becomes too small to get investors to bid prices up, which would drive prospective returns down further. In fact, the reward-to-risk ratio could make those who are long a lot of assets view that terribly returning asset called cash as more appealing. As a result, QE becomes less and less effective. If they provide QE and private credit growth doesn’t pick up, policy makers feel like they are pushing on a string. . 主要提到了QE的问题，很多钱涌入市场是需要寻找收益的，会推高资产价格，当价格过高而收益降低，投资者就没有足够的意愿去承受高风险带来的低收益，而更愿意持有现金，QE就会降低效果。 .",

            "content": "There are two main ways in which failed lenders’ assets or existing lenders’ bad assets are managed: They are either a) transferred to a separate entity (an AMC) to manage the restructuring and asset disposal (about 40 percent of the cases studied) or b) they remain on the balance sheet of the original lending institution to manage (about 60 percent of cases). And there are several main levers for disposing of the nonperforming loans: a) restruc turing (e.g., working out the loans through extended terms), b) debt-for-equity swaps and asset seizures, c) direct sales of the loans or assets to third parties, and d) securitizations. . 这儿介绍了对于lender来说集中处理债务危机的方式。 . For systemically important borrowers or strategically important ones, policy makers generally take steps to ensure that the businesses remain intact as entities. In general this occurs through a restructuring of the debts to make the ongoing debt service manageable. This can occur through debt-for-equity swaps, through reducing the existing debts, lowering interest rates, or terming out the borrowing. Occasionally policy makers also introduce new lending programs to these borrowers to ensure their ongoing liquidity. This process is often explicitly one of the goals of AMCs set up to manage bad debts . 对于系统性或者策略性上重要的借款人来说，policy maker也会在必要的时候帮助处理一些债务的问题。 . As shown below, both inequality and populism are on the rise in the US today, much as they were in the 1930s. In both cases, the net worth of the top 0.1 percent of the population equaled approximately that of the bottom 90 percent combined. Typically, increased taxation takes the form of greater income, property, and consumption taxes because these forms of taxation are the most effective at raising revenues. Wealth and inheritance taxes are sometimes also increased, though these typically raise very little money because so much wealth is illiquid that it is practically, difficult to collect on, and forcing the taxpayer to sell liquid assets to make their tax payments undermines capital formation. Regardless, transfers rarely occur in amounts that contribute meaningfully to the deleveraging (unless there are “revolutions” and huge amounts of property are nationalized). . . 最近美国对收入税的调整，以及打算对富人征税都是反映了以上的观点 .",

            "content": "Typically, in the early stages of the top, the rise in short rates narrows or eliminates the spread with long rates (i.e., the extra interest rate earned for lending long term rather than short term), lessening the incentive to lend relative to the incentive to hold cash. As a result of the yield curve being flat or inverted (i.e., long-term interest rates are at their lowest relative to short-term interest rates), people are incentivized to move to cash just before the bubble pops, slowing credit growth and causing the previously described dynamic. Unemployment is normally at cyclical lows and inflation rates are rising. The increase in short-term interest rates makes holding cash more attractive, and it raises the interest rate used to discount the future cash flows of assets, weakening riskier asset prices and slowing lending. It also makes items bought on credit de facto more expensive, slowing demand. Short rates typically peak just a few months before the top in the stock market. . . yeild curve 倒挂，短期利率达峰是会在股市到顶点的几个月前。 . With investors unwilling to continue lending and borrowers scrambling to find cash to cover their debt payments, liquidity—i.e., the ability to sell investments for money—becomes a major concern. As an illustration, when you own a $100,000 debt instrument, you presume that you will be able to exchange it for $100,000 in cash and, in turn, exchange the cash for $100,000 worth of goods and services. However since the ratio of financial assets to money is high, when a large number of people rush to convert their financial assets into money and buy goods and services in bad times, the central bank either has to provide the liquidity that’s needed by printing more money or allow a lot of defaults. As this implies, a big part of the deleveraging process is people discovering that much of what they thought of as their wealth was merely people’s promises to give them money. Now that those promises aren’t being kept, that wealth no longer exists. . 解释了萧条期为什么要印钱（inflationary）或者债务违约（deflationary）。人们觉得拥有的债券或者股权，在萧条期无法换成钱（来换成商品或者服务），因为市场上流动性不足，人们觉得是自己的钱，其实只不过是别人的承诺，是完全有可能违约的。 . Since borrowers’ creditworthiness is judged by both a) the values of their assets/collaterals in relation to their debts (i.e., their net worth) and b) the sizes of their incomes relative to the sizes of their debt-service payments, and since both their net worth and their income fall faster than their debts, borrowers become less creditworthy and lenders more reluctant to lend. Even as debts are written down, debt burdens rise as spending and incomes fall. Debt levels also rise relative to net worth, as shown in the chart below. As debt-to-income and debt-to-net-worth ratios go up and the availability of credit goes down, naturally the credit contraction becomes self-reinforcing on the downside. . . 即使一些债务重组或者违约了，还是不能让借款者借到钱，因为债务负担减少的速度比收入和资产减少的速度要慢。 .",

            "content": "In many cases, monetary policy helps inflate the bubble rather than constrain it. This is especially true when inflation and growth are both good and investment returns are great. Such periods are typically interpreted to be a productivity boom that reinforces investor optimism as they leverage up to buy investment assets. In such cases, central banks, focusing on inflation and growth, are often reluctant to adequately tighten money. This is what happened in Japan in the late 1980s, and in much of the world in the late 1920s and mid-2000s. This is one of the biggest problems with most central bank policies—i.e., because central bankers target either inflation or inflation and growth and don’t target the management of bubbles, the debt growth that they enable can go to finance the creation of bubbles if inflation and real growth don’t appear to be too strong. In my opinion it’s very important for central banks to target debt growth with an eye toward keeping it at a sustainable level — i.e., at a level where the growth in income is likely to be large enough to service the debts regardless of what credit is used to buy. Central bankers sometimes say that it is too hard to spot bubbles and that it’s not their role to assess and control them—that it is their job to control inflation and growth. But what they control is money and credit, and when that money and credit goes into debts that can’t be paid back, that has huge implications for growth and inflation down the road. The greatest depressions occur when bubbles burst, and if the central banks that are producing the debts that are inflating them won’t control them, then who will? The economic pain of allowing a large bubble to inflate and then burst is so high that it is imprudent for policy makers to ignore them, and I hope their perspective will change. . 大部分央行的目标是控制通胀或者通胀就增长。但没有明确说要控制债务水平。Ray觉得既然央行是money和credit的创造者，那自然就有义务控制债务水平，太高的债务水平导致不能偿还会有很大的可能性影响增长和通胀。 . To identify a big debt crisis before it occurs, I look at all the big markets and see which, if any, are in bubbles. Then I look at what’s connected to them that would be affected when they pop. While I won’t go into exactly how it works here, the most defining characteristics of bubbles that can be measured are: 1) Prices are high relative to traditional measures 2) Prices are discounting future rapid price appreciation from these high levels 3) There is broad bullish sentiment 4) Purchases are being financed by high leverage 5) Buyers have made exceptionally extended forward purchases (e.g., built inventory, contracted for supplies, etc.) to speculate or to protect themselves against future price gains 6) New buyers (i.e., those who weren’t previously in the market) have entered the market 7) Stimulative monetary policy threatens to inflate the bubble even more (and tight policy to cause its popping) . . 这里Ray给了一个定性的表格，从7个维度衡量泡沫，估计桥水内部会有一个更精确的模型吧。 .",

            "content": "While the central bank can alleviate typical debt crises by lowering real and nominal interest rates, severe debt crises (i.e., depressions) occur when this is no longer possible. Classically, a lot of short-term debt cycles (i.e., business cycles) add up to a long-term debt cycle, because each short-term cyclical high and each short-term cyclical low is higher in its debt-to-income ratio than the one before it, until the interest rate reductions that helped fuel the expansion in debt can no longer continue. In the short-term debt cycle, spending is constrained only by the willingness of lenders and borrowers to provide and receive credit. When credit is easily available, there’s an economic expansion. When credit isn’t easily avail able, there’s a recession. The availability of credit is controlled primarily by the central bank. The central bank is generally able to bring the economy out of a recession by easing rates to stimulate the cycle anew. But over time, each bottom and top of the cycle finishes with more economic activity than the previous cycle, and with more debt. Why? Because people push it—they have an inclination to borrow and spend more instead of paying back debt. It’s human nature. As a result, over long periods of time, debts rise faster than incomes. This creates the long-term debt cycle . 短期的债务周期组成了长期债务周期。每一个短期的低点一般都高于上一短期的低点，当利率降到接近0，就无法继续刺激增加信贷。 . You will note how the interest payments remain flat or go down even when the debt goes up, so that the rise in debt service costs is not as great as the rise in debt. That is because the central bank (in this case, the Federal Reserve) lowers interest rates to keep the debt-financed expansion going until they can’t do it any more (because the interest rate hits 0 percent). When that happens, deleveraging begins. . 借债越来越多，但利率越来越低，所以还款并没有增加多少，但当利率不能再降，也就也就意味着还款压力就上来了，这个时候就要开始去杠杆了。 . Remember that money serves two purposes: it is a medium of exchange and a store hold of wealth. And because it has two purposes, it serves two masters: 1) those who want to obtain it for “life’s necessities,” usually by working for it, and 2) those who have stored wealth tied to its value. Throughout history these two groups have been called different things—e.g., the first group has been called workers, the proletariat, and “the have-nots,” and the second group has been called capitalists, investors, and “the haves.” For simplicity, we will call the first group proletari at-workers and the second group capitalists-investors. . 钱有交换和存储价值的作用。无产者用时间换钱换生活必需品。资本家用钱生钱来存储财富。 .",

Even the biggest debt crises in history (e.g., the 1930s Great Depression) were gotten past once the right adjustments were made. From my examination of these cases, the biggest risks are not from the debts themselves but from a) the failure of policy makers to do the right things, due to a lack of knowledge and/or lack of authority, and b) the political consequences of making adjustments that hurt some people in the process of helping others. It is from a desire to help reduce these risks that I have written this study. . 债务本身的问题不是最大的，而是决策者是否有认识和能力去做出正确的措施，以及这样做的政治后果给决策者带来的顾虑（比如给富人加税导致失去政权）。 . I want to reiterate that 1) when debts are denominated in foreign currencies rather than one’s own currency, it is much harder for a country’s policy makers to do the sorts of things that spread out the debt problems, and 2) the fact that debt crises can be well-managed does not mean that they are not extremely costly to some people. The key to handling debt crises well lies in policy makers’ knowing how to use their levers well and having the authority that they need to do so, knowing at what rate per year the burdens will have to be spread out, and who will benefit and who will suffer and in what degree, so that the political and other consequences are acceptable. . 承接上面，有认识，有能力，并清楚知道不同方案各个方面的影响是否可以接受是处理债务危机的关键。 . There are four types of levers that policy makers can pull to bring debt and debt service levels down relative to the income and cash flow levels that are required to service them: 1) Austerity (i.e., spending less) 2) Debt defaults/restructurings 3) The central bank “printing money” and making purchases (or providing guarantees) 4) Transfers of money and credit from those who have more than they need to those who have less Each one of their levers has different impacts on the economy. Some are inflationary and stimulate growth (e.g., “printing money”), while others are deflationary and help reduce debt burdens (e.g., austerity and defaults). The key to creating a “beautiful deleveraging” (a reduction in debt/income ratios accompanied by acceptable inflation and growth rates, which I explain later) lies in striking the right balance between them. In this happy scenario, debt-to-income ratios decline at the same time that economic activity and financial asset prices improve, gradually bringing the nominal growth rate of incomes back above the nominal interest rate. . 减少支出，债务违约和重组，央行印钱，劫富济贫（富人加税）是四种手段。有些手段是通胀的，有些事通缩的，怎样完美地去杠杆（债务收入比减少的同时通胀可控并且经济复苏）是需要平衡这几种收端的。 .",

            "content": "Credit is the giving of buying power. This buying power is granted in exchange for a promise to pay it back, which is debt. Clearly, giving the ability to make purchases by providing credit is, in and of itself, a good thing, and not providing the power to buy and do good things can be a bad thing. For example, if there is very little credit provided for development, then there is very little development, which is a bad thing. The problem with debt arises when there is an inability to pay it back. Said differently, the question of whether rapid credit/debt growth is a good or bad thing hinges on what that credit produces and how the debt is repaid (i.e., how the debt is serviced) . Generally speaking, because credit creates both spending power and debt, whether or not more credit is desirable depends on whether the borrowed money is used productively enough to generate sufficient income to service the debt. . 如何使用信贷，有没有直接或者间接的产生高于贷款利率的价值（产品或者服务）是判断一个credit/debt好坏的标准。 . I strongly preferred saving to borrowing, because I felt that the upsides of debt weren’t worth its downsides, which is a perspective I presume I got from my dad. I identify with people who believe that taking on a little debt is better than taking on a lot. But over time I learned that that’s not necessarily true, especially for society as a whole (as distinct from individuals), because those who make policy for society have controls that individuals don’t. From my experiences and my research, I have learned that too little credit/debt growth can create as bad or worse economic problems as having too much, with the costs coming in the form of foregone opportunities. . Ray的态度是个人层面他更倾向于存钱以及不要借太多钱。而国家层面是不同的，因为不借钱而错过的机会成本比借太多导致问题的成本要大。 . To give you an idea of what that might mean for an economy as a whole, really bad debt losses have been when roughly 40 percent of a loan’s value couldn’t be paid back. Those bad loans amount to about 20 percent of all the outstanding loans, so the losses are equal to about 8 percent of total debt. That total debt, in turn, is equal to about 200 percent of income (e.g., GDP), so the shortfall is roughly equal to 16 percent of GDP. If that cost is “socialized” (i.e., borne by the society as a whole via fiscal and/or monetary policies) and spread over 15 years, it would amount to about 1 percent per year, which is tolerable. Of course, if not spread out, the costs would be intolerable. For that reason, I am asserting that the downside risks of having a significant amount of debt depends a lot on the willingness and the ability of policy makers to spread out the losses arising from bad debts. I have seen this in all the cases I have lived through and studied. Whether policy makers can do this depends on two factors: 1) whether the debt is denominated in the currency that they control and 2) whether they have influence over how creditors and debtors behave with each other. . 决策者如何处理坏债是关键。决定因素在于，这些债是本币还是外币，以及决策者对creditors和debtors的影响力。 .",

This means that the higher the return rate, the higher the risk of loss of capital. Another principle, however, says that risk is more related to skill and knowledge. Both of these statements are true, but for different reasons. If you think about a fast race car, it’s a more risky vehicle to drive, but if you know how to drive it, the risk goes down. There are two conclusions from this. First, having a margin of safety in terms of principal is a good idea. In other words, having a low withdrawal rate is safer than a high withdrawal rate, because the required rate of return is lower. A larger fund thus allows for more safety. Second, invest in what you understand rather than what people tell you. This is the main reason I’m not telling you what to invest in. If you don’t know anything about investing, make it a point to learn!” . “Monte Carlo simulations suggest that a withdrawal rate of 4% is good for 30 years of inflation-adjusted expenses and that a withdrawal rate of 3% is good for 60 years or more. A withdrawal rate of 2% will last forever–that is, if history repeats itself.” . “In summary, the organic growth of any sector seems to concentrate around 3% real growth. This is the number I would use as a safe withdrawal rate. It’s difficult to judge whether this number will be representative of the next 50-100 years.” . 作者在最后几章里提了一些基础的财务相关的计算和原则。这里聊了一下safe withdraw rate (SWR), 作者觉得3%对于他自己来说会是非常舒服的百分比：假设退休时有100w，那每月消费就是100w x 3%/12，然后每月按CPI调整。这和我最近看的一个博客Big ERN里面的分析基本一致，当然博客里写了更多仔细的分析，并且用了historical simulation并没有用Monte Carlo，原因博客也讲了。虽然美国的情况并不能代表全世界，过去也不能预测未来，但个人觉得如果一定要我猜一个数的话，60年退休期，最终资产为0，最安全的取出率应该在3-3.5%之间。 .",

Thus, if you ever want to deal with a service company, simply ask to speak with their retention department to negotiate a better deal.” . 获客成本是沉没成本，所以作为消费者来说，应该去拿到更好地retention deal . “Voluntarily stepping out of the consumer cycle and saving enough to replace one’s job with investment income instead of working isn’t “normal.” The great majority of people do neither, and those who do one almost never do the other. Anyone not consuming as much as possible tends to do so out of external necessity and thus doesn’t have savings to invest. Anyone investing for income tends to have plenty of money and thus consumes at an average if not above average level. There are few doing both; most do neither.” . 远离消费主义和让投资收入足够财富自由，这两件事很少有人在同时做。人没钱，所以买不起东西，人有钱了就买很多东西。主动地克制自己的欲望，即使很有钱了，也不买没有必要的东西，本身就是一件需要在成为有钱人之前就培养好的习惯。 . “An ecosystem has four components, which form a cycle: Abiotic (resources), producers, consumers, and decomposers. Modern economics only considers two of these relevant: producers and consumers. It ignores the finite abiotic resources and presumes that their only limit is the producers’ ability to turn them into commodities. Similarly, consumers and producers ignore decomposition. Once our waste and detritus is dumped into landfills, lakes, rivers, and the atmosphere, and is out of sight, it is, for all intents and purposes, out of mind. Meanwhile, the finite planet is running out of its finite resources (duh!) and pollution keeps increasing and is starting to bite back. Typically, the economists solve this problem by waving their hands and mumbling something about substitution and human ingenuity. However, it’s obvious that our cultural paradigm is incomplete and that resources and decomposition capacity can no longer be considered infinite.” . 作者点出了工业化后的生产消费模型的问题所在：人们有意忽略了资源的有限性和分解能力的有限性。我们只在乎生产和消费。 .",

Here’s how it works: Instead of buying when I develop a spontaneous desire to purchase something, I put it on my wish list along with the date of the wish. Don’t buy anything unless it has been on the wish list for at least 30 days. You will likely find that you have either found an alternative to buying it in the meantime, perhaps by finding an alternative or by learning how to do without it.” . 这个把东西写在wishlist里30天后再决定要不要买的方法其实挺好的，避免自己冲动购物。尤其是对自己喜爱的东西，人们总是更不能抑制自己的欲望。 . “If I have to get something new, like rollerskates, I just get last year’s model. Last year’s inventory is typically cleared at certain times of the year, so keep an eye out and be ready to pick it up; it goes fast!” . 真要买新东西的时候可以考虑去年出的“新产品”。这个非常适用于电子产品，就比如macbook pro，新款的性能大部分人都是用不到的，那就可以考虑在打折的时候买macbook air或者13寸的pro。 . “Low-intensity exercise (see the list of intensity levels in this table) doesn’t burn many calories–a pound of fat, that is 4,200kcal, will supply enough energy for a 50mile run–and it doesn’t burn any energy after the run. In fact, it may even be detrimental. Conversely, adding a pound of muscle mass increases the daily metabolic rate by 75-100kcal just to keep the muscle alive. It’s thus clear that decreasing muscle mass is self-defeating as a strategy to fat loss” . 提高新陈代谢率是减肥的有效手段之一，撸铁来增加肌肉质量，从而达到消耗更多的卡路里。 . “The optimal interval for strength and endurance is the Tabata interval, which means 20 seconds of all-out exercise followed by 10 seconds of rest and repeating this sequence throughout the entire workout; that is, working roughly 2/3 of the time. Increasing the weight and rest-to-work ratio prioritizes strength. Decreasing the weight and rest-to-work ratio prioritizes endurance. Pure endurance aims for working 100% of the time.” . 休息运动时间比1：2是一个可以参考的指标。增加重量以及增加rest-to-work ratio可以偏重于力量。反思自己最近一年健身，感觉在没有加重量的情况下，rest-to-work ratio太高了，差不多做30秒休息1.5分钟。 .",

Despite this, and perhaps due to short-sightedness or failure to take the systemic problem into account, owning many things is often confused with a high quality of life. Hence, reducing the amount of stuff is perceived as a major barrier. As a counter-reaction, a recent trend towards simplification is to own as few things as possible. Here, the barrier prevents owning more things. The optimal point is somewhere in the middle. In particular, it’s important to realize that it’s not the things themselves that are the problem; it is their side effects! ” . 拥有物品的成本不仅仅买来时的价格，还有拥有它的空间和时间成本。作者觉得物品需要有好的质量和低的lifetime cost，这不代表这个物品的价格低。举个栗子，买把切菜刀可以很便宜，也可以很贵，便宜的刀可能2年就不行了，贵的刀加一定的保养可能可以用20年甚至更长时间。 . “Annual cost = (Your cost - Used price)/(Years in service). The depreciation principle is widely understood to apply to cars, given the popularity of the used car market. Most people have an idea of the blue book value of their car–that is, how much it can be sold for used. However, everything else has a market price even if it doesn’t have an army of salesmen or corresponding blue book. Make it a point to know the market price of all your stuff. Doing so makes it a simple matter to calculate the annual depreciation cost, which is the true cost of ownership. Everything I own is for sale. In my mind, I’m only holding it temporarily. If I need something else for a while, I can always buy it on eBay or find it on Freecycle or Craig’s List. In this way, these become like giant libraries of stuff I can “rent” for a while at the cost of depreciation. With sufficient capital, the initial outlay never matters. What matters is the depreciation cost because this determines how much value can be recovered. Even though this is nominally ownership, I prefer not to think of it this way, which allows me to avoid becoming attached to my stuff.” . 这儿作者具体说了他觉得物品只是暂时拥有，成本可以按每年的成本来计算。 .",

This works like compound interest and it’ll create exponential growth” . “However, compound interest in itself never made anyone rich. Invest $1 at 8% and wait 30 years to get $10. This is hardly a worthwhile sum for 30 years of waiting. But invest $100,000 at 8% for 30 years and you get $1,000,000. That is real money. To get anywhere, it’s thus very important to quickly build a substantial foundation. Setting small goals in a situation which depends on exponential growth is a guaranteed way of not seeing results very fast. Conversely, putting in a large initial effort is a guaranteed way of seeing immediate and growing returns. The middle of the curve shows a proportional relationship between effort and results–work more and get more results; work less and get fewer results. In other words, this is the stage where extra effort is rewarded more than it was in the beginning, because it’s leveraged by the now higher production.” . “With further effort, the production ceiling starts to kick in due to limits on resources, customers, responsibilities, market size, etc. You might have found yourself with a job description that could be done in three hours a day even though you nominally have to work for eight hours. If so you know what I mean about reaching the productivity ceiling. In such a situation, it makes little sense to increase work effort by 25% if the return in productivity only increases by five percent. In such a case it is better to start additional projects, look for more responsibility, or learn something else. These projects would then each have their own curve for you to progress along.” . 这儿讲了一个sigmoid function, d(total productivity)/d(total effort)=(1-P)P。当P比较小的时候，增长的速度是比较小的。想要到达类似指数级增长，必须要有一个比较大的基础，P=1/2的时候增长率最大。这也就像是财富的积累，当你只有一点本金的时候，即使你做了最正确的投资决策，也很难快速积累。当有一定量的本金后，那财富增长才能类似指数增长。但当你的资金到达了一定规模想要长期继续这种增长又变成不可能，因为你撞到了行业、市场、资源的天花板，以及你的资本可能已经是大头了。这样你继续努力，其实增长就变得不值得，在这个时候可以选择去做别的事。 . “The optimal life strategy is to maximize total “production” for all the things you engage in or whatever the curves are measuring–presumably you’d have a curve for each project and multidimensional returns for each project, where total utility (see Building blocks) is maximized (see Ecological). Pricewise, it would be impossible to quantify because it would require you to determine the exchange rate between health, money, satisfaction, meaning, etc., some of which can’t be quantified. Those values can be subjectively determined, though (see Emotional).” . 最佳策略其实应该是根据个人的优先级去平衡人各个方面的产出，使总产出达到最大。这里比较难以科学的去衡量，所以大概是那个意思。 .",

These lists are both helpful and useless at the same time. They are helpful because they allow people to pick up a thing or two that they have not seen before, but they are useless because few people are capable of memorizing hundreds of little rules that might not even apply directly to their situation and remember to obey all of them. In that sense, tips are like a collection of pretty postcards or pictures of specific instances of a particular way of living. They are interesting to look at, but they do not substitute for a map of the lifestyle, nor do they substitute for navigating the map, and most importantly, knowing them does not make anyone an expert.” . 相比于记住一些tips，鸡汤，学会如何找到一件事的“地图”和“原则”，如何用“地图”为自己导航更为重要，因为一旦找到根本性的原则，那战术在很多时候就会变得很自然。 . “Focusing on utility rather than consumer products or instructions is a key tactic. Success is then redefined from accumulating and consuming the maximum number of products or the most expensive products to deriving the maximum utility.” . 最大化的不是你积累了多少东西或者东西多贵，而是东西本身的价值比如耐用性、观赏性、对个人的独特意义等等。 .",

A second-order negative effect of this is spending money to make up for this, either by taking drugs or shopping. . 这里提到的鱼骨图还是挺有意思的。衡量是否要去做一件事，先找到它最根本的zeroth-order effect作为鱼骨的脊椎。然后找出first-order postive和first-order negative effects，再从first-order effect出发找出second，third order effects。然后综合去衡量一件事对于一个人来说是更加积极还是消极。如果比较难判断，那作者觉得这件事就态度砸了，干脆不做。作者同时也提示，second- or third-order effects可能长期积累也会有很深刻的影响。 . 可以拿读书来举个例子。对于我来说读书： zeroth-order effect是丰富自己的内心。 . first-order postive effect: 拓宽自己的视野，从不同的视角看世界。 second-order postive effect: 能够帮助在工作生活中多角度看问题 | second-order negative effect: 如果缺少思考和选择看什么书，容易被带跑偏 | . | first-order postive effect: 发现自己的无知，以及看到世界的广阔。 second-order positive effect: 让自己养成谦逊的品质 | . | first-order negative effect: 以我的看书习惯比较费脖子，对健康有影响 second-order postive effect: 促使我经常起来活动 | . |",

            "content": "A very common and very good piece of career advice is not to work to earn money but to work to learn new skills, gain new connections, and create new opportunities. . 这儿说的比较死。没人会和钱过不去，但如果硬要做选择的话，那机会、人脉、有意义的技能都是更高优先级的。 . “Slowness can be achieved through delayed gratification. In a world of scarcity, instant gratification is the optimal strategy. In a world of abundance, delayed gratification is the optimal strategy. Genetically, there’s a preference for the former, which means that a mature person with a measure of self-control has an advantage, being able to wait for bargains. It also means if you have patience and don’t depend on speed, there are fewer costs to be paid for the additional power that speed otherwise requires. It’s helpful to master the art of waiting. We are prone to action, but often the problems we perceive as urgent turn out to be less than urgent. Sometimes they will even resolve themselves without any interaction.” . 合理的等待，和延迟满足在很多时候是省钱，提高性价比的好方法。尤其是在物质丰富的时间，延迟满足的效益往往高于即刻满足。我们以为很紧急的事，比如新出一个什么产品，其实等一阵子价格自然下来了，甚至我们会想清楚也没必要买，可以有其他的替代品或者选择不种下这个因。 . “Another way to think of a heterotelic response to a problem is that it aims to fix a single symptom of, say, a disease. If the response causes undesirable side effects, additional drugs are taken in an attempt to fix these side effects. Here many arrows are used in the figure to try to get closer to the desired goal. The heterotelic response makes particular symptoms more bearable and tends to encourage more problem-causing behavior. If hiding the symptoms is effective, then Liebig’s Law of the minimum suggests that additional symptoms will appear. If these in turn are treated heterotelically, then eventually the underlying problem will become so large that the system fails catastrophically (stress -&gt; burn out -&gt; depression -&gt; heart attack) or simply becomes unsolvable. Conversely, the homeotelic response aims to fix the entire problem–that is, cure the disease. Naturally, this is the ideal approach, but it requires a wiser approach to the problem. An important part of the systems thinking approach is to continuously increase the number of different problems that the strategy aims to solve or the number of different goals that the strategy intends to meet.” . 停留于表面，不断给“系统”打补丁，最终会造成灾难性的后果。统一性的复杂解决方案去从根本上解决问题，满足多方需求是需要不断去思考和实现的。 .",

            "content": "“It’s important to understand that doing the right thing (good strategy) is much more important than doing things right (good tactics).” . 和我在五年反思里提到的一点很相似的。 . 战术上的成功战略上的失败 . 人们往往意识不到自己在“错误”的道路上越走越远，虽然每一步走起来都很“成功”，但最终确实走进了一条死胡同，甚至是不归路。 . “As indicated in the diagram, the Renaissance strategy is based on a combination of consilience–a specific way of weaving widely different tools and ideas together to solve complex problems–and resilience, which is based on the principles of modularity, diversity, and slack (loosely coupled feedback processes). Resilience is the foundation of most behaviors observed in nature. After all, if they weren’t resilient, they would be extinct. While not completely equivalent, consilience shares a lot with typical businesses strategies which can be transferred to the individual sphere. ” . . 关于consilience这个词，一直没太搞明白它具体的含义： . the linking together of principles from different disciplines especially when forming a comprehensive theory . 它是指不同原则之间形成联系比如一种完备的理论。在书里其实作者想要表达的是，做为一个人，如果技能点点地集中，那意味着你只能完成特定地某一类工作，就会类似流水线的工人一般，对于你的总产出会比较好预测，因为不涉及到复杂的多技能、部门协同，比如领固定工资的人和打多份工的人。与之相对的，是需要编织一个全面的技能网，去实现复杂目标的人。 . resilence这个词就比较好理解，就是弹性、抗风险能力的意思。对于一个复杂系统，如果它的多样性不够，或者子系统耦合程度太高（部分的瘫痪会导致全局性的瘫痪），或者安全边际与反馈太少，那么系统就不够有弹性。对应到人身上，比如一个家庭如果只有一个人工作来支持一家人的生活，那大多数情况下这样的模式抗风险能力就比较低，单点失败会导致整个家庭生活有巨大影响，比如个人的技能，如果一项技能水平非常差，导致成为明显的红灯，那也是需要考虑把短板补足到至少不拖后腿的程度（或者短期内找到弥补短板的人或者方法，但长期还是补足自己的能力为好）。 .",

            "content": "最近开始关注李沐大神的B站，李沐大神是机器学期、深度学习届的大牛，MXNET的主要作者和维护者之一，在分布式机器学习领域有很重要的贡献，现在任职于AWS做Senior Principal Scientist (应该是L8等级，如果硬要对标国内的话估计在阿里的P10,P11等级）。在翻看大神视频的间隙，看到了一篇大神的工作五年反思以及另一篇用随机梯度下降来优化人生，深受触动。因此，也想借此机会写一篇工作五年总结（08/2016 to 10/2021）来做一次五年反思。 . 做有价值的事 . 对自己的价值 . 做一件事对个人的价值可以是提升自身的能力和思维，获得即时的反馈或者是延迟的反馈。就拿一块石头最比喻，做对自己本身有价值的事就像是延拓石头空间的边界（例如进入新的领域），可以是打磨石头本身（例如在一个领域深耕），还可以是改变石头本身材质比如从沙子压缩成了钻石（提升核心能力和思维层级）。投资自己，做对自己有价值的事，是所有事的基石。这让我想起了Ray Dalio在他很有名的视频How the economic machine works最后的建议中提到的 . Rule one: Don’t have debt rise faster than income. Because your debt durdens will eventually crush you. 量力而行。 | Rule two: Don’t have income rise fast than productivity. Because you will eventually become uncompetitive. 德要配位。 | Rule three: Do all that you can to raise your productivity. Because, in the long run, that’s what matters most. 投资自己是长期最终要的事 | . . 对核心圈的价值 . 这儿我想把自己身边能够直接影响到的人(核心圈)和更广泛的“社会”区分开来。核心圈可以包括身边的人比如夫妻，子女，直属亲人如父母，直接工作伙伴如直属上级下级、直接同事，亲密的朋友。根据李沐大神一件事的价值公式 . 受益人数 x 人均时间 x 单位时间价值差 . 因为核心圈的人数本身不容易增加，也不应该轻易增加，因此重心应该是放在提升人均时间和提高单位时间价值上。比如李沐大神提到了，陪他的儿子，虽然会对工作时间、质量等方面造成影响，但这件事提供了大量陪孩子的时间以及世界上独一无二的价值：一个父亲和子女的互动的单位价值远远高于与一个平均的人互动的价值，以及它是不可替代的，并会有非常对孩子和父亲都有非常深远的影响。 . 对核心圈以外的价值 . 对于核心圈以外的价值其实有点类似于，把你自己这一块石头投入社会这个大的海洋中，泛起的涟漪就是你的影响。大部分人只是小石头，影响非常有限，少部分人是更大、更重的石头，有些甚至能到达陨石级别，它们所激发的能量能够影响成千上万人，甚至跨越时间地影响后世。在这个层面，要做的有价值的事，可能是做一个受众很广的产品。这个产品可以是物质的比如袁孔平老先生的杂交水稻，也可以是精神的比如乔布斯的斯坦福演讲。这一切的前提在于你本身的能量，传播路径和受众的理解度，只有当两者兼备的时候给社会带来的更多价值。假设一个人或产品本身没有实打实的能量，那即便受众很大，带来的实质影响从深度和广度来说也是有限和片面的，就有点像你把一大把沙子均匀的洒进大海，和一个同质量的陨石带来的影响，是完全不同的。同时，如果你没有很好地关心传播途径和受众本身的接受度，那即使你的能量很大，那对受众的影响也是有折扣的。 . 现在的社会把传播路径已经做得非常好了，这并不是说我们就不需要投入精力在这上面，而是不能仅仅把资源和精力放在路径上。打铁还需自身硬，同时想清楚自己想要影响什么样的人群，怎么样更好地使他们理解等等。现在太多的人在“肚子空空”的情况下火了，这也许能够带来短暂的流量、金钱、地位，但对于个人长期来说并没有益处。 . 目标的选择 . 就像李沐大神在用随机梯度下降来优化人生里提到的，目标要大，如果你很轻易地知道你要走到哪里，通过大概什么样的途径，那可能目标就不够大。很多人会说“这是对大神来说，我一个普通人不需要什么足够大的目标”。这中理解反映了几个问题： . 并没有用成长的心态去看待自己，觉得自己的才能是恒定的，并不能有巨大的成长。自知之明的意思并不是限制一个人的发展，而是认清楚自己目前所在的位置，一步一步去走向目标 | 目标足够大都是因人而异的。你的大目标可能别人的小目标，但这并不代表你的目标就不足够亦可赛艇，也不代表不需要你付出足够多的努力。不要被别人玩的游戏影响了自己的人生 对于生长在和平年代的我来说，财务自由是下一个阶段要实现的目标，做到资产带来的被动收入足够支付的支出。当不再为一辈子的生计发愁时，目标应该会是影响更多的人，给别人带来帮助和价值，而至于是什么价值，这会是一个不断变化的答案。而现在的我还是像李沐大神所说的，把时间专注在未来3年的目标上会比较好，在此期间，其实也有很多机会实现为核心圈提供价值和为社会提供价值的机会。 | . 对工作五年的反思 . 最近写过一篇在WhatsApp的这三年反思了近三年的工作，在18年跳槽的阶段写了选择FB跳槽总结以及Oracle Internet of Things Cloud，也多多少少的每年年末写了一些年度的反思。现在回头来看，从刚来美国读了一年master就毕业的出入职场的小白，到今天有幸在组里承担TL的工作，5年间的收获颇丰。工作5年来最大的收获，其实并不是做的项目，也不是升了职，而是是工作生活中培养的习惯：终生学习，深入思考和勇于尝试。 . 终生学习 . 这个在WhatsApp的反思中也有所提到，从19年底培养了阅读的习惯，进而拓展到了终生学习。就像苏格拉底在《申辩篇》里提到的，真正有智慧的人是会觉得自己其实没有什么智慧，自己的所知就像一滴水相较于大海一般的渺小。终生学习是唯一能够了解自己的无知的唯一途径，也正是通过阅读各种学习书籍、博客、文章，看各种教程，我越发清晰了自己的短期和长期目标。 还有一点对于终生学习的思考是关于广度和深度的问题。在Early Retirement Extremely一书里提到了文艺复兴人的概念，也就是会很多领域的技能。 . A Renaissance man is a person who is competent in a wide range of fields, covering intellectual areas as well as the arts, physical fitness, and social accomplishments. This contrasts with the more modern, specialized approach, where a person is encouraged to build skills in a single vocation and use the income from that to pay for everything else. . 个人认为广度是必要的，但并不是说浅尝辄止，而是一项技能或者对一个领域的理解至少到达到可以工作的水平（working proficiency）。举个栗子，如果想要学剪头，那收益至少要达到剪完头的人能够正常的走出去。至于深度，我觉得可以现在一个领域到达专家的水平，在这个过程中我们往往培养了不仅仅是知识的积淀，还有习惯的培养比如如何深挖一个领域，遇到问题如何解决等等。当再一个领域到达专家水准后，很多技能和习惯是可以迁移到相近领域的。 . 深入思考 . 仅仅是照单全收的学习肯定是不行的。有很多优秀的书籍并不是工具书，需要一个人能够想象自己就是作者，去理解表象背后的逻辑，才能真正运用在自己所面对的问题中。最近李沐大神的“带你读论文”系列的视频也提到了相关的内容，比如要站在当年的背景去想如果是自己在论文作者的位置上会做出什么样的选择，以及从现在的观点反观当年的选择，思考可不可以做出更好地选择。总结来说就是需要有pre-morterm的思维和post-mortem的思维去思考一件事。 . 《Deep work》和《The One Thing》的书中都提到了留出足够的大块时间给最高优先级的事，但现代社会有太多东西可以使我们的时间碎片化。在工作中邮件、通知、聊天、会议、各种各样的工作事项，都可以轻易侵吞整块的时间，每天感觉做了很多事，但又感觉做的事都是一些杂事，没有很系统的思考优先级。我觉得无论一个人在什么等级，都需要留出足够的时间不受打扰地思考优先级，哪怕这可能让你不能兼顾到所有事项（而导致一些事的延迟甚至失败）。我们不能用战术上的成功来掩饰战略上的失败，捡了芝麻丢了西瓜非常容易，有勇气花时间去思考当下、几个月内、几年内最有意义的事，并坚持去做，并及时反思和调整，是非常不容易的。在决定了优先级后，其实可以把自己是怎么思考，参考了什么而做出这个决定的过程给记录下来，在复盘的时候可以用后验的视角去反思。 . 勇于尝试 . 小步快跑，勇于试错是李沐大神在用随机梯度下降来优化人生也提到过的点。对于一个复杂目标来说，除了要有一开始的目标选择和深入思考外，勇于尝试，及时做小反馈和小调整是很重要的。尤其是尝试新的领域，在没有积累的情况下，很少能在一开始就有灵感而看见对的东西，从别人的经验中借鉴是一种方法，但最终我们还是要去自己实践和调整。看得再多，不亲身实践和体会，那也只能浮于表面。最近的工作里也是在思考未来三年组里应该要投入哪一块，能有大致的想法，但是任何宏伟的宫殿有再完善的设计还是需要有一个接一个的项目，一砖一瓦搭建起来的。很多人在一开始也都会持怀疑或者观望的态度，只有你拿出了一定的成绩和原型，别人才会愿意来继续投资。因此三年计划不能只停留在计划上，而是要有短期的成效和收益来平衡长期的投入，至少得把饼画的别人摸得到，而不是只停留在ppt上。 .",

            "content": "“Compared to a plan, which may be thought of as a string of actions, subject to complete failure if it breaks, a strategy is better thought of as a web of actions. A web does not fail catastrophically if it’s cut in a single, or even a few places. It’s resilient, whereas a plan is not. This is why having a strategy is much preferred to having a plan. . 线性的计划很容易因为其中的一环偏差、出错导致整个计划出现严重的错误。在设计的时候需要考虑策略的每一环有哪些风险，每一环和每一环之间有哪些风险，关键的节点需要有plan B甚至plan C，当计划的执行出现问题时，有没有预案止损等等。 . “A web comprises and connects a person’s thoughts, ideas, experiences, memories, goals, values, desires, connections, assets, liabilities, predictions and expectations. Here, a larger inventory of the aforementioned means there’s a greater variety of possible strategies and that any given plan becomes more flexible. Focusing solely on the coordination aspect and ignoring the tactics can result in “clueless manager syndrome.” Conversely, focusing solely on the knowledge of tactics or skills described in Human capital and necessary personal assets would only produce a person with a multitude of hobbies. Only the combination of skills and coordination will unleash the creativity of an expert. Creative synthesis occurs when you’re able to see principles as an abstract model representation and apply the abstracted model elsewhere. With experience, you’ll see that the number of such models in the world is actually quite limited.” . 既要做到掌握节点之间的协调和全局，也要熟悉节点自身的运作规律。其实要做到这个是很难的，很少有人能够同时顾全大局，同时又事无巨细的关注到细节。当项目小的时候只涉及到5-10个人，还是有可能做到的，但一旦超过10个人，就需要有一定的结构和抽象，并设置一些“警报”去帮助自己管理整个项目。 发现一件事背后的模式和规律是很重要的，而这样大的规律其实非常有限：认清楚事物和人都是螺旋上升或者螺旋下降的，合理地运用好正负反馈。 . “This means that one doesn’t need another 10,000 hours to become an expert in another field, even if it’s only marginally related. It means that it’s easier to master several different fields than is commonly assumed.” . 当成为一个领域的专家，其实很多背后的道理都是相通的，因此成为另一个领域的专家其实不需要太长时间（当然如果是完全不相关的领域可能需要的时间更久）。 .",

            "content": "“The main mistake when dealing with an overwhelming amount of data and stuff is to reduce it, rather than relating to it on a more abstract level. It’s always easier to cut away than it is to create, but it’s not always the best solution.” . 做减法不一定是最好的选项，可以考虑对问题更好地如何做抽象。做抽象能够减少概念，如何把这些把一个大的概念、系统解耦合，控制好不同部分的交互与自由度，因为一旦自由度高了，系统的复杂度就会指数增长。 . “For a creative person, workload management with external constraints is especially stressful. A manager executing simple procedures may more easily divide his day into 15-minute slots and do different things in each slot.39 A creative person and even a craftsman can’t do so, as both need time to retool. For the creative person, the retooling happens subconsciously, and when the retooling is complete, inspiration suddenly strikes. This means that it’s perfectly possible to switch between things, even rapidly, according to where the inspiration strikes. For instance, at any one time I have four to six simultaneous projects going. If I restricted myself to just one project for the sake of simplicity, or tried to switch projects on a pre-arranged schedule dictated by time management, there would be a lot of downtime when my subconscious was processing a problem while I would be sitting around doing nothing and being underutilized. Hence, not allowing yourself to do anything but focus on one specific task will actually not increase productivity for creative work. It will only increase productivity for assembly line work (see Economic degrees of freedom) or the management thereof.” . 这是一个很有趣的观点：一个管理者在处理简单任务的时候可以把时间分成小份，比如15分钟。但对于创造者来说，肯定不能每15分钟做一件事，然后切换到下一样完全不同的事，因为context switch会非常花费时间，往往在做下一件事的时候潜意识里还在处理上一件事。作者还表达了一个观点，比如我们在做某件不相干的事的时候意识中突然会闪现一些其他事的灵感，这是潜意识的作用，我们可以根据优先级的不同，either把灵感记下来并写好什么时候去处理，or马上去处理。作者个人会同时做4-6个项目，这样可以让自己的潜意识在消化问题的同时，可以做其他事，减少down time，我觉得如果是做4-6个非常高压的项目的话，非常不推荐，应该控制在2个以内，其他的2-4个应该是没有压力的项目或者优先级比较低没有很紧张的ddl，即使没做好也不会影响大局。 . “It should be clear that the more diverse and independent the parts of the system are, and the more complex the system itself is, the greater its survival rate. Conversely, a simple, specialized system with interdependent parts, like a career professional, is likely to break as soon as circumstances change” . . 由很多独立的子系统组成的复杂系统的存活率会很高，相反，子系统间如果相关度、依赖度越高，只针对某种目的存在的特殊化系统，在情况发生改变的时候越容易产生问题。上图在3中提到过，如果一个人对于单个点的知识非常丰富，那他转移专业的成本就会非常高，而如果对于多个领域都有相当的理解，那切换赛道就会信手拈来。 .",

Education is supposed to transform and build the character, mind, and body of the students. The point of an education is to learn a systematic way of improving those aspects–exercising, researching, and figuring things out to build a foundation for continued learning for the rest of one’s life, so that one may live his life to the fullest extent possible. Learning must become a habit (see Ergodicity and destiny) that is applied to all aspects of life before it can be said that a person is truly an educated person.” . 教育的终极目的是培养人的身心为终生学习做准备。 . “For instance, in the sciences, a young, technically adept person will be able to quickly crunch numbers and manipulate equations, while perhaps not quite understanding the underlying concepts of his chosen specialization, whereas a more experienced person will quickly understand the underlying concepts of even unfamiliar subject areas. In physics and mathematics, such experienced people are said to have physical intuition or mathematical maturity, respectively.” . 掌握了解大局的思维方式，即使遇到了自己不熟悉的领域，也能快速地了解大体情况。 . “Now, there are many ways of measuring experience, the most popular being tenure. However, working in the same place for five years does not imply five years of experience.

            "content": "“We have a political model that is based on leading in the popular polls–a model where barely differentiated political leaders pretend to be different by steering voters away from important issues and onto subjects that, albeit emotional, are of little consequence to most people–a model where the election is won by the person with the best marketing, and where consistency and integrity are irrelevant.” . 所谓的西方选举制度，无非是比谁更会拉资本，做营销。对于“真才实学”完全不关心。 . “We have an economic model that is based on pulling resources out of the ground and mostly turning them into unnecessary products, getting people to buy the products by convincing them that they need them, then getting them to throw the products away because they’re obsolete. This makes people buy the next model and bury the other one in the ground. The sole goal of this seemingly pointless exercise is to work faster and grow the gross domestic product, which measures the resource churn.” . 所谓的经济，就是不断开采资源，做出大部分人们本身不需要但又被洗脑觉得一定需要的产品，年复一年地淘汰就产品产出新产品，GDP是用来衡量一个国家资源利用(浪费)的效率。这其实也让我反思，我们真的需要那么多产品和服务吗，有什么是可以完全不用的，有什么是需要的但不需要经常更换的。比如手机，我觉得买个性能最好的用个5年时没啥问题的，比如笔记本电脑，13年买的顶配macbook pro，硬件数据放在2021年也还凑活能用。可能有一个问题是，自己接受不了被主动或被动地被身边的人比下去，这是一个思维的问题，外物并不能定义你的人生，自己想通了就好。 . “We live in a world where the money necessary for our way of life comes out of a slit in the wall as long as we keep showing up for work, yet only experts understand the fiat-based money/credit system. We live in a world where food can be heated in a microwave oven at the touch of a button, yet only experts understand how this works. This goes for most of the other technology we use. All we know is that if we press this or that button, things magically happen.” . 现代人有太多的惯性，太多的抽象以至于我们不屑了解背后的原理和惯性的原因。比如人为什么要每天工作？因为要赚钱。为什么要赚钱？因为可以提高生活质量。为什么要提高生活质量？因为看到别人买了xxx，用着xxx，去了xxx旅行等等，看起来过的很好，很快乐。这儿其实没有说我们不需要工作，不需要赚钱，但深挖下去会发现我们并不明白赚多少钱算够，能够让自己和家庭未来的生活无忧，也不明白工作除了赚钱还有什么特别的意义，是否可以考虑换一份工作、行业。 .",

For instance, a financially irresponsible person doesn’t become a millionaire by winning $1 million. He merely becomes a financially irresponsible person with $1 million, and eventually the lucky money will be gone. A person becomes a millionaire by becoming the sort of person who “deserves” $1 million. . 怎么成为”百万富翁”？买彩票赢了一百万并不能让一个人成为百万富翁。是一个人的头脑有能力让他拥有一百万，他才能有机会成为并保持百万富翁。 . “Conversely, my dream was financial independence, which means that investment income safely covers expenses. Hence, I spent most of my time thinking about how I could a) lower my expenses and b) increase my investment income. Hence, I didn’t have a particular net worth in mind, nor did I think particularly hard about ways to make more money.” . 对于财富自由的定义有很多。作者的定义是投资带来的收入可以安全的支付开销，那为了实现目标，就要研究增加投资收入和减少开销。至于要赚更多的钱，其实并不是直接目标。假设一年10万可以让你过的很好（考虑通胀），那就要研究怎么样让自己的开销控制在10w以下，并怎么让投资收入能够足以长期支持每年10万（考虑通胀)的开销。 . “Combined with self-confidence, agency is the attitude that any problem can be fixed, given enough resources in the form of time, effort, and determination. This attitude rests either on a thorough knowledge of or training in what is to be done, or on the surety that such knowledge or training can be attained. This attitude is often transferable from one field to another, completely unrelated field. Doing something that is considered very difficult at least once in your life is highly recommended.” . 只要投入足够资源（时间，努力和决心）任何问题都是可以被解决的。这样的经验是可以转移到不同的领域的，甚至是毫不相关的领域。 .",

Wage slaves are free to choose other products as long as they can afford it, but they’re not capable of creating alternatives to buying products, because they’re too busy working.” . 工作的奴隶：又是一个正反馈的例子，因为赚钱越多也要买贵的好的大的，为了承担这样的生活方式只能更努力地工作。 . “Unlike the salary man and the working man, the businessman doesn’t risk losing his job, though he does risk losing his business. Like an exuberant artist or scientist, he is internally driven towards finding solutions and he does not wait for employment to start working–the businessman is an entrepreneur. The risk for the businessman comes from the tight coupling between shareholders and bond holders on one side and consumers and workers on the other side, all of whom must be satisfied with the businessman in the middle, lest capital and profits vanish.” . 书里讲了四种人，salary man就是以一份为别人打工的工作为生的，working man是以多份短期工作卫生的有点类似于自由职业者，business man这里提到了是主动解决问题的，必须在股东、债权人与顾客、员工之间做平衡。 . “A Renaissance man is a person who is competent in a wide range of fields, covering intellectual areas as well as the arts, physical fitness, and social accomplishments. This contrasts with the more modern, specialized approach, where a person is encouraged to build skills in a single vocation and use the income from that to pay for everything else. ” . Renaissance man有点类似于handyman，会很多基本技能，很少需要甚至不需要用金钱去买很多服务与产品，大部分时间能够自给自足。 .",

            "content": "以下只是我的个人经历，不具有普适性，仅供参考。 在FB工作在很多湾区程序员的印象里就是卷，加之最近几年出现的各种社会性新闻，给人一种感觉在FB工作的人WLB总不会太好。确实，有的组会比较卷，半夜发diff，做oncall的也确实是事实，这个时候摆在我们面前的有几个选择： . 继续卷burn late night oil | 出淤泥而不染：坚持自己的作息，看看是否能维持正常的绩效（当然有pip的风险） | 组里环境改变不了，那就改变自己：换组，换公司 | . 这里不做道德评判，每个人都有权利做出符合自身情况的选择。这儿我想谈谈我一直以来的作息变换。刚进组的时候因为一切都是新的，前半年到一年会比较努力地去赢得同事和经理的信任，所以工作时间基本上是每天9：30到12：00，13：00到5：30，除去中间的一些休息，大概实打实6-7小时，这样的工作时间看起来似乎也不怎么长，但加上通勤1小时，其实心智投入在和公司相关事的时间有9个半小时（9：00-18：30）。以至于每天回到家吃完饭后就没有意志力去做一些自己的事，大部分的时间都成了couch potato在看视频和刷手机中度过，也就是典型的rat race：起来上班，瞎忙活一天到7点，感觉完全没有力气做一些知道有意义的事，只能靠刷各种app看视频来放松直到睡觉，第二天repeat。这种循环大概持续了一年多。那段时间我非常明显的意识到自己完全没办法摆脱这种循环，每天就在工作，刷手机，看视频，睡觉中度过，明明知道有更重要的事，但就是不能开始或者没办法坚持。 . 最终是读书“解救”了我。在19年底，完成了一个大项目后，当时的我第一次感觉到了工作带来的burnout，这让当时的我放慢脚步做了一个反思，决定20年要养成坚持读书的习惯。这个习惯是一切改变的起点，让我学习了投资自己，做有意义的事比如冥想、健身、理财等等，更重要的是让我改变了对工作的看法。一直以来我和大多数人一样觉得工作无非就是赚钱，向上爬，给退休囤积足够的钱等等。这些观点本身都没有任何问题，但看待每一个的角度都可以有调整和深挖，赚钱是为了实现财务自由的一种手段，向上爬是为了带领团队做出超越自己一个人能做的极限。而工作本身的意义在满足了基本温饱后，就不仅仅是局限在物质层面，无论是创业还是打工，追求还是一个意义，如果工作本身不能提供你认可的意义，那就纯粹是为了钱工作，那选择换一个工作会是比较好的选择。 . 有了很多思想上的转变后，我现在的工作和生活就有了非常大的改观。工作日每天会花4-6小时非常高效的工作，给自己列出一天，一周，一个月，一年最重要的一件事，只要在时间段内完成好那一件事就行。一般这会话2-3小时集中精力不受打扰去做，其余的2-3小时就可以做一些必须要完成或是琐碎的事。现在每天9-5工作，中午睡个午觉，晚上6-11留给自己充电。这样的工作节奏能够让我在第二天有足够精力集中注意力在工作上，反而极大的提高了我的工作效率和产出。相比于之前一天9.5小时相对低效的工作，现在能用4-6小时高效的工作，其他时间休息或是做自己的事，反而极大的提高了在工作中的表现。 . 最后做个小总结： . 减少通勤时间，或者完全WFH，公司的食堂和其他福利不足以支付你精力的损失。这样能够节省0.5-1小时。 | 每天高效工作的时间控制在4-6小时。极限不应该超过8小时（不能长期持续，必须用PTO来恢复，建议不是非常情况不要让自己集中工作超过6小时） | 每天选择1-2件最重要的事用50%以上的专注时间去完成（3小时、半天） | 每天剩余的工作时间（2-3小时处理杂事和相对不重要的事） | 每天注意休息，能够有午休尽量休息30-60分钟 | 每天留4小时给自己，可以是工作结束后，也可以工作开始前。如果是工作结束后，可以适当休息比如洗澡，睡觉后再开始自己的时间。 | 在自己的4小时中，合理规划。比如可以1小时看书，1小时运动，1小时做做项目，1小时放松等等。每件事有固定的时间段去做，但不要塞得太满，给自己充足的放松和转换的时间。 | 每个1小时中，看每天的状态，状态好可以50分钟做事，10分钟划水，状态不好可以20分钟做事，40分钟划水。重在坚持。 | .",

            "content": "“The design presented in the rest of the book rests on three pillars. First, reduce waste and increase efficiency. Many of these expenses are eliminated by only owning what is actually used, and maintaining what is bought.” “Second, having significantly reduced expenses, invest the difference in businesses.” “Third, find something meaningful to do instead of work. If your work is really meaningful to you, you can keep working, knowing that you are living a less wasteful existence and that you have the financial security to leave your job at any time. ” . 做减法，留下真正用的东西，好好地使用和维护。投资。做有意义的事，而不是无脑的做别人让你做的工作。 . “Each reinforces the other two, but none of them rely on the others. The money saved from reducing waste can be invested, and the method leading to savings can be cast as a meaningful activity. Conversely, meaningful activities can often provide income in a way that reduces waste. In addition, savings allows one to invest in better quality–for example, paying eight times as much for something that lasts ten times longer, instead of being stuck with a low-end model that only serves to increase waste and money losses.” . 前面提到的三点是互相独立，但又互相加强。减少浪费可以增加投资，找出储蓄的活动本身也是有意义的事。而往往有意义的事可以增加收入和减少浪费。做投资也可以是买高性价比，高质量的产品从而减少浪费。 . “Coupling is a measure of a person’s dependence on the world, economic here. In principle, it also measures the world’s dependence on the individual.” “For instance, a consumer that is fully dependent on a paycheck is more likely to stay employed and not quit his job. Hence, employers can make the supply of labor more predictable by only offering full-time jobs, which makes employees unlikely to go home early, and tying in generous benefits, which makes employees unlikely to quit.” “It naturally follows that slack or loose couplings have a cost, in that they’re less efficient under normal operations. Conversely, they’re less costly under disrupted operations, such as in catastrophes. Changing the tightness or looseness of a coupling is therefore a way of adjusting risk versus profit. Here risk is defined as uncertainty rather than loss.” . 耦合是系统成功(失败)和个体成功(失败)的紧密程度。给员工提供更好的福利，延长工作时间（使人们没时间想别的），是雇主希望达到可预期留存率的手段。简单的说每个人都有自己的很多想法，那这个人就不好管理。当个体不是那么依赖整体的时候，个体的风险（不确定性）就低了，整体的不确定性反而变高，整体效率下降。 .",

However, a ladder implies that if one climbs hard enough, one eventually will get to the top. In reality, it’s more like a corporate pyramid. Not only does one have to climb hard; one also has to beat the other climbers as the pyramid gets narrower and narrower.” “Here, one solution is to moderate one’s career ambitions. After all, realizing at an early point that going all the way not only depends on skills, but also requires 100% dedication, reading time, and possibly some ethical compromises, one can aid in the sorting process by consciously seeking positions suitable to one’s more moderate aims and avoiding unnecessary competition.” . 其实现在已经感受到职场晋升并不是一个阶梯，而是金字塔。约到上层位置越少，并不是说纯粹的努力就可以做到的，机遇，想法，人脉，能力都是决定了在职场中能够达到的位置。反过来说，等级越高并不代表者他的能力越强。想清楚适合自己的位置，避免不必要的竞争。 . “the item is considered desirable simply because it’s expensive. This locks one into a spiral of “upgrading”: An expensive shirt leads to the purchase of an expensive suit; the car must match the expensive home. An increase in pay allows one to buy goods which previously seemed like a luxury. Another increase leads to another upgrade. Soon these become a normal part of life and people start identifying with them. When you identify with an object, you’re defined by the object, then controlled by it, and ultimately owned by it. If you relate to your possessions, you’re owned by your stuff, and it will make many of your decisions for you. This trap is not only mental, but also physical.” . 消费升级，生活状态的通胀，被物质所拥有。消费升级到一个程度，其实就不需要继续升级了，但通过与别人比较，企业媒体政府的宣传和洗脑，总觉得自己赚100万不能用赚10万买的东西，赚到1000万，也要考虑买1000万收入的东西。自此，不是我们拥有权利去选择物质，而是物质决定了你要继续拥有什么样的物质。 . “The result is a downward spiral of fewer skills -&gt; greater need for technology -&gt; more work -&gt; less time to practice the remaining skills -&gt; further loss of competence. The more things consumers think they need, the more control they relinquish over their lives and the more their lives are shaped by the products they own.” . 典型的正反馈，下降通道。一个人被各种用的产品所定义。 .",

We’re even following Keynes’ suggestion quite literally when we dig resources out of the ground, fashion them into consumer objects, temporarily store them in our homes, rarely use them, and eventually replace them with a new and bigger model, while sending the old and likely still functional object to a landfill–back in the ground” . 什么是现代社会，把资源从地里挖出来，做出产品，暂时的被人们买回家存放，很多时候很少回去用，很快出了更新的产品，人们就把旧的产品扔了，重新回到土地掩埋。这样的东西在生活中可太多了，比如自己的switch，电视，无人机，gopro等等。 . Living to work and spend, it’s not surprising that people derive their main identity through their job title and their purchases:”what do you do for a living and which brand names do you buy to express your lifestyle?” . 物化，每个人对身份的定义往往是“我叫xxx，我在xxx公司做xxx”，而别人判断你个人的“品味”也是通过你的衣着打扮，用的产品，开的车等等来判断。我们往往都太容易通过外表去判断一个人，贴一个标签，下一个结论。 . “This figure shows a narrow delta function representing the skills of a specialist. A dotted line and an arrow represents the shift in demand. The demand now lies almost entirely out of the specialist’s supply. This requires the specialist to work very hard to stay on target. The figure also shows a wider bell curve that represents the skills of the generalist. During a similar demand shift, the overlap between the new demand and the generalist’s supply is substantial. Here, a large problem is that previously acquired, specialized knowledge can’t be used as a foundation for new specialized knowledge–by definition, only generalized knowledge can serve this purpose.” “The only thing the specialist knows is how much effort it took to reach the level of the former specialization and that this must now be repeated probably several more times throughout his career.” Creating a system based on specialized production thus increases productivity, but at the cost of increased risk to and pressure on the individual. . . 知识面和技能面现代人完全比不了“古代”人。这带来了一个很严重的问题，那就是过于专业之后切换跑到的难度就非常大，尤其是跨行业。从投资的角度来说，就是all-in一个资产和多样化的区别。 .",

To live as a free person, following lists of easy, repetitive things, possibly in return for some reward, is exactly what should be avoided. Instead, it’s necessary to understand how the world works and how people have been specialized to the point of general incompetence, like ants, which only know how to do one job, but do it very well; this is not human nature. To live well, one must go beyond lists and start thinking creatively about solving problems.” . 用同样创造出问题的思维去解决问题是不可行的。比如一个人工作了很久还是觉得自己很穷，那他保持同样的工作方式，消费水平继续工作30年，也很难让他变得很富有。现在社会讲究分工来提高总体的生产效率，而忽略了人们最基本的生存技能，企图用一份工作赚的钱去支付另外的所有开销。这本身并不是一种自然的选择。 . What Gandhi said “Be the change you want to see”, may sound trite, but that doesn’t make it untrue. . 一个人怎么去影响身边的人乃至整个社会，成为一个你想要整个社会都成为的人。改变自己是我们唯一可以把握的，身教的力量远远超过言传。 . The question you need to answer is what you want to do with your life given that you don’t have the time to do everything? Do you want to spend most of your life paying off the interest of a 30-year mortgage and working so you can fill increasingly bigger houses with increasingly more stuff while being stuck in your daily communte in increasingly nicer cars? Or are you prepared to give up the stuff so that you can do whatever you want, whenever, and wherever, with reason? What will your legacy be-what you owned or who you were? . FIRE: 财富自由，提早退休。其实强调的重点在于财富自由。财富自由，并不是说你赚了大钱，而是你所拥有的财富足够长时间地支持日常的开销，而你不需要为了钱而做一些自己并不喜欢的事来换取支持生活的钱。提早退休也不代表着一般意义上60岁从一份工作中退休而不工作了，而是有自由去选择自己想做的事，从不得不做的事中退休。 . In other words, you need to believe your lifestyle as an end rather than as a means to an end. To wit, runners and other athletes sometimes get the reverse cum hoc ergo propter hoc comment that they’re already git, so they don’t need to exercise. Yet their diligent exercising is exactly what causes their fitness. How is doing good, creating wealth, establishing connections-in short, accomplishing anything-any different? . 把过程(因)作为终极目的，而不是结果最为终极目的。运动带来好的身材，并不意味着运动员就不需要运动了(因为他们已经有好身材了)，而是因为他们运动才有的好身材。 . “Barriers represent a cost which must be paid. The willingness to pay depends on a combination of dissatisfaction with the present situation, vision of the future situation, and the practicality of changing from the present situation to the future situation. This will to change can be represented by the volume of the pyramid in the figure. The volume of the pyramid represents the will to change from an unsatisfying situation to something else and depends on vision, how practical the change is, and the level of dissatisfaction with the situation.” . . Increase your dissatisfaction with present situation. | Strengthen your vision of future situation. | Build a plan to get from the present to the future. | Lower the perceived cost of the plan. | 对现状越不满，对未来的状况越有清晰的目标，对计划越有具体的规划，对计划的成本越有清晰的认识，实际做出改变的概率就越大。 .",

Test-taking became the primary objective; learning secondary. We had the option to quickly forget what we had spent the past year learning after the test was done. In other words, we were being taught to be “flexible.” Later, there were job fairs and educational fairs telling us how to write résumés and how to interview so we could get jobs. Yet, I never learned why the world worked the way it did, and in retrospect, I think nobody ever even asked the question. Everybody always only focused on the “what” and “where;” no questions asked.” . 高度的分工，工业的生产让整个社会的效率提高了无数倍，需要的是每颗螺丝钉的专精和服从，随时可能被替换。学校训练最多也是服从，在学校服从老师，追求成绩，在社会服从老板，追求业绩，一条龙。 . “In real life, the prisoners of Plato’s Cave are those who are prisoners or slaves to their wages and their culture. A wage slave is a wage earner who is entirely dependent on their wages. While the wage slave is free to leave the current job, he isn’t free to leave the job market altogether and he can likely not imagine the possibility of doing so. He is still entirely focused on the wall.” . “A wage slave is a person who is not only economically bound by mortgages, loans, and other obligations, but also mentally bound by an inability to perceive that there are other options available, like the prisoners in Plato’s Cave. Their chains are not physical like those of 150 years ago (though they still are in some parts of the world); the chains are mental, which in some sense makes them worse, because it turns the prisoners into their own prison wardens. Like the slaves in Plato’s Cave, the only commonly accepted way for one of them to leave is to win the “prison game,” which means accumulating at least a million to retire” . 柏拉图的洞穴理论。看似的自由，比如人可以选择自己从事的工作，这本身就是被限制在了大前提，一个成人在现代社会一定要工作。在这种理论下，成功的定义就是一直工作知道积累了足够退休的财富。自我的思想的束缚比150年前物理的铁链还要有效果，毕竟人不可能做自己认知之外的事，不认为自己有除了“一直工作到退休”以外的可能性这个枷锁本身是非常可怕的。 . “Frequently, when someone is depressed, the advice is “Go out and spend some money. Buy yourself something nice. Treat yourself. Try a little retail therapy.” People don’t seem to realize that this attempt to feel good is exactly what propagates the problem. Compared to people just 50 years ago, modern wage slaves live a life of material abundance. They’re consumers” . “Similarly, many of the ways we used to do things have been redesigned to ensure that instead of doing it ourselves, we can buy some gadget or some service to have it done for us. This is convenient, because we’re usually too busy working to pay for it to do it ourselves” . 消费主义和高度分工是一个闭环。一个人只会做自己的工作，工作赚的钱来以相对的高价买其他的产品和服务，越工作，越只会一小部分事，越用钱去娱乐、缓解压力、满足各种需要，欲望也就越大，就只能越努力工作去赚赚钱。 .",

            "content": "这本书是作者采访一些“天才疯子”（主要是精神病人）的记录，每一章都是一个很有意思的小故事。 . 唯物论也好，唯心论也好，其实不冲突，大家看待事物的角度不一样。只要不用自己所掌握的去祸害别人，那就算自我认识提高了，没什么大惊小怪的。像我前面说的：你不相信并不能影响客观现实的存在 . 世界很大，容得下不同的理解。别把自己的理解强加给别人，而是分享给别人，产生一些思想的碰撞。对于自己不相信的东西，不了解的东西不要妄下结论，你不相信不代表他客观存在也不代表别人不相信。 . “我：“你没明白，死这个概念太复杂了，我用了其中一种而已。也算是自我暗示的。每天睡前，我都会告诉自己：我即将死了，但是明天会重新出生的。” 她：“明白了，真的可以那样吗？” 我：“不知道对别人是不是管用，但我很接受自己的这种暗示。每天早上，我都是新生，一切都是过去式了。虽然会有记忆，但那种状态只是一种时间旅行的状态，重点在于：旅行。就象出去旅游，心里明白总要回家的，这样思维上的死结很快就解开了，就是说跳出来了。每当面对一个新患者的时候，我总是尽可能的全身心去接受，全身心的融入，尽可能谦卑，尽可能的让对方放大自己的空间，我可以背负着全部。但是当晚，我死了，我卸下了全部。比方说情感方面卸下了，而那些观点和知识作为资料收起来，就象人体内的淋巴系统一样，病毒碎片收集起来，增加了免疫力。其实电脑杀毒软件不就是那个原理吗？我也借用了，借用在思维上。不是我多强大，而是我学会了一种状态，用精神上的仿生淋巴系统来自我保护。” 她：“……朝生暮死……” . 这是一种很奇妙的状态，每天都代表着新生，也代表着死亡，当下的正面负面的感受都打包整理化为养分。 . 问题就出来了，好人，其实代表的就是一个社会价值观。什么样的社会价值观呢？一个标准环境下的社会价值观：你要勤奋工作，才能融入社会，做社会的一份子，成为社会的一个组成个体。好好工作，孝敬父母，娶妻生子，最后安享天年。为什么要这样呢？因为社会需要这样的人，需要大量这样的人，如果都不这样，社会就不存在了，就成黑社会啦！不过，我很想知道大家真的都是这样安于现状吗？我觉得不是，但是又都没有特别聪明的脑袋，所以只好先这样过了。而且，没聪明脑袋的人是绝大多数，实际上到了这个时候，不聪明的人才是社会的真正组成者，个别有那么一点儿聪明，又不够坏的人只好安于现状，因为真正主导这个社会的，是不聪明的人。不管你怎么样，都不许出头，都按下去，老老实实按照一个模式走出来。你想出头？不可能的，你周围都是不聪明人组成的团体，怎么会让一个有点儿聪明的人发挥呢？其实这才是一个根本性的要点. . “问题就在于，有一部分很聪明的人发现了这点，但是又没别的办法，只好当坏人了，因为最快的获取方式，不是成功，而是掠夺。如果你读的世界史足够，你就会明白，欧美的强大，依靠的不是文明或者宗教，是掠夺。他们的生活方式甚至都是这样的。比方说他们治病吧，怎么治？把病毒也好，细菌也好，杀死在体内，杀不死，那个人就死了呗，他们会说：神不放开这个人。” . 原来依靠武力掠夺，现在依靠精神掠夺。人再厉害也躲不过社会国家的大背景，顺势而为是大多数人的选择。而真正的天才或者疯子，往往决定他们命运的就是成败。比如怀特兄弟如果飞机没有发明成功而摔死了，现在可能甚至没人知道他们，或者觉得是两个神经病，人怎么可能能飞呢。 . “所以杀人到底是对错的概念不是你决定的，而是你所在的群体决定的。你的群体赋予你杀人的权利了，你就可以杀。不给你杀人的权利，你杀人是要受惩罚的。因为你没有杀人牌照。” . 同样是杀人，没经过允许的杀人就成了杀人犯，经过允许的杀人（比如战争）就承认战斗英雄，但站在对立方确实“大魔头”。还是回到上面的一点，谁成功了制定了标准和规则。 .",

You can be wrong half the time and still make a fortune, because a small minority of things account for the majority of outcomes.” “It is fine to have a large chunk of poor investments and a few outstanding ones. That’s usually the best-case scenario.” . 其实人生大部分的走势也就是几个决定的事。精力总是有限的，平均投入到所有细节中只会分散了核心问题所能获得的关注。 . “Use money to gain control over your time, because not having control of your time is such a powerful and universal drag on happiness. The ability to do what you want, when you want, with who you want, for as long as you want to, pays the highest dividend that exists in finance.” . 什么是自由。自由就是不被定义，不被当成工具在别人指定的时间、地点，做指定的事，而可以在我想要的时间、地点做我想做的事。 . “Savings that aren’t earmarked for anything in particular is a hedge against life’s inevitable ability to surprise the hell out of you at the worst possible moment.” . 这是中国人习以为常的事，但在西方社会需要被特意提出来说，毕竟大家习惯了举债生活。 . “Define the cost of success and be ready to pay it. Because nothing worthwhile is free.” . 愿意为成功付出代价，尤其是别天真地以为投资的成功没有代价。 . “Room for error often looks like a conservative hedge, but if it keeps you in the game it can pay for itself many times over.” . 给自己留余地。 . “Define the game you’re playing, and make sure your actions are not being influenced by people playing a different game. . Respect the mess. Smart, informed, and reasonable people can disagree in finance, because people have vastly different goals and desires. There is no single right answer; just the answer that works for you.” . 了解自己，别被和你玩不一样游戏的人所影响自己的决定。 . “Sandy Gottesman, a billionaire investor who founded the consulting group First Manhattan, is said to ask one question when interviewing candidates for his investment team: “What do you own, and why?” . 这确实是no bs，show me your money. . “I mostly just want to wake up every day knowing my family and I can do whatever we want to do on our own terms. Every financial decision we make revolves around that goal.” . 财富自由不是为了赚更多的钱为目标，而是实现能够自由的选择过自己的生活。 . “On the rare occasion when I question our savings rate I think of the independence my parents earned from years of high savings, and I quickly come back. Independence is our top goal. A secondary benefit of maintaining a lifestyle below what you can afford is avoiding the psychological treadmill of keeping up with the Joneses. Comfortably living below what you can afford, without much desire for more, removes a tremendous amount of social pressure that many people in the modern first world subject themselves to. Nassim Taleb explained: “True success is exiting some rat race to modulate one’s activities for peace of mind.” I like that.” . 实现自由是首要目标，自己的收入水平大于自己满意的生活水平。避免社会压力与比较，rat race是永远不会有尽头的。 . “Effectively all of our net worth is a house, a checking account, and some Vanguard index funds.” “My investing strategy doesn’t rely on picking the right sector, or timing the next recession. It relies on a high savings rate, patience, and optimism that the global economy will create value over the next several decades. I spend virtually all of my investing effort thinking about those three things—especially the first two, which I can control.” . 做着自己的投资组合：20%左右的cash让自己睡个好觉，一个全款的房子，剩下的所有钱都在一些Vanguard指数基金里。非常简单。 .",

Partly because the stakes are so high in investing.” “Consider that 85% of active mutual funds underperformed their benchmark over the 10 years ending 2018.⁶⁵ That figure has been fairly stable for generations. You would think an industry with such poor performance would be a niche service and have a hard time staying in business. But there’s almost five trillion dollars invested in these funds.⁶” . 人们想通过投资赚钱，所以听一些电视“专家”的意见，这些专家自己也没什么可以证明投资逻辑的案例，甚至从数据上来说，满满的“失败”的案例。 . “Everyone has an incomplete view of the world. But we form a complete narrative to fill in the gaps.” “[History] cannot be interpreted without the aid of imagination and intuition. The sheer quantity of evidence is so overwhelming that selection is inevitable. Where there is selection there is art. Those who read history tend to look for what proves them right and confirms their personal opinions. They defend loyalties. They read with a purpose to affirm or to attack. They resist inconvenient truth since everyone wants to be on the side of the angels. Just as we start wars to end all wars.” “Hindsight, the ability to explain the past, gives us the illusion that the world is understandable. It gives us the illusion that the world makes sense, even when it doesn’t make sense. That’s a big deal in producing mistakes in many fields.” . 每个人都不可能完全的客观，有选择就有艺术。人们永远在尝试解释这个世界，很多的理论都是建立在一些公理上的，这些公理一旦被推翻，那所有的理论就自然不成立。这并不是说理论没有用，而是什么时候用什么样的理论很重要。 . “Wanting to believe we are in control is an emotional itch that needs to be scratched, rather than an analytical problem to be calculated and solved. The illusion of control is more persuasive than the reality of uncertainty. So we cling to stories about outcomes being in our control.” . 控制感是一种自我和解。虽然绝大部分人没有办法控制自己的命运，总是在随波逐流。 .",

Optimism is a belief that the odds of a good outcome are in your favor over time, even when there will be setbacks along the way. The simple idea that most people wake up in the morning trying to make things a little better and more productive than wake up looking to cause trouble is the foundation of optimism. It’s not complicated. It’s not guaranteed, either. It’s just the most reasonable bet for most people, most of the time. The late statistician Hans Rosling put it differently: “I am not an optimist. I am a very serious possibilist.” . 乐观主义：自己长期的行为能够让天平为自己倾斜一点。 . “Tell someone that everything will be great and they’re likely to either shrug you off or offer a skeptical eye. Tell someone they’re in danger and you have their undivided attention.” “When directly compared or weighted against each other, losses loom larger than gains. This asymmetry between the power of positive and negative expectations or experiences has an evolutionary history. Organisms that treat threats as more urgent than opportunities have a better chance to survive and reproduce.” “progress happens too slowly to notice, but setbacks happen too quickly to ignore.” “Growth is driven by compounding, which always takes time. Destruction is driven by single points of failure, which can happen in seconds, and loss of confidence, which can happen in an instant.” . 人的本性总是生存是第一位的。好事需要长期的积累，坏事往往只要全局中有一点坏了，就会牵连整个局势。 . “Expecting things to be great means a best-case scenario that feels flat. Pessimism reduces expectations, narrowing the gap between possible outcomes and outcomes you feel great about. . Maybe that’s why it’s so seductive. Expecting things to be bad is the best way to be pleasantly surprised when they’re not. . Which, ironically, is something to be optimistic about.” . 降低自己的预期，当结果非常好的时候就会成为惊喜。这何尝不是一种乐观的精神。 .",

If an asset has momentum—it’s been moving consistently up for a period of time—it’s not crazy for a group of short-term traders to assume it will keep moving up. Not indefinitely; just for the short period of time they need it to.

Like a car thief—though well-meaning and law-abiding—they form tricks and strategies to get the return without paying the price. They trade in and out. They attempt to sell before the next recession and buy before the next boom. Most investors with even a little experience know that volatility is real and common. Many then take what seems like the next logical step: trying to avoid it. . But the Money Gods do not look highly upon those who seek a reward without paying the price. Some car thieves will get away with it. Many more will be caught and punished.” . 这里作者举了一个车的例子：你可以选择买新车接受价格的波动，你可以买个便宜的二手车选择相对低的不确定性，你也可以选择偷一辆车选择不付出金钱。类比投资，很多人选择“偷”车，只能赚钱不能亏钱，以为自己能够长期做到低买高卖，付出很少的代价（波动性，风险）去赚更多的钱。 . “Morningstar once looked at the performance of tactical mutual funds, whose strategy is to switch between stocks and bonds at opportune times, capturing market returns with lower downside risk.⁵⁰ They want the returns without paying the price. The study focused on the mid-2010 through late 2011 period, when U.S. stock markets went wild on fears of a new recession and the S&amp;P 500 declined more than 20%. This is the exact kind of environment the tactical funds are supposed to work in. It was their moment to shine. . There were, by Morningstar’s count, 112 tactical mutual funds during this period. Only nine had better risk-adjusted returns than a simple 60/40 stock-bond fund. Less than a quarter of the “tactical funds had smaller maximum drawdowns than the leave-it-alone index. Morningstar wrote: “With a few exceptions, [tactical funds] gained less, were more volatile, or were subject to just as much downside risk” as the hands-off fund.” . 太多的事实证明很多所谓的“策略”都是“失败”的：付出更多风险，收获更少，或是不能避免downside risk。这还是和60/40的无脑组合相比。 . “The question is: Why do so many people who are willing to pay the price of cars, houses, food, and vacations try so hard to avoid paying the price of good investment returns? . The answer is simple: The price of investing success is not immediately obvious. It’s not a price tag you can see, so when the bill comes due it doesn’t feel like a fee for getting something good. It feels like a fine for doing something wrong. And while people are generally fine with paying fees, fines are supposed to be avoided. You’re supposed to make decisions that preempt and avoid fines. Traffic fines and IRS fines mean you did something wrong and deserve to be punished. The natural response for anyone who watches their wealth decline and views that drop as a fine is to avoid future fines. ” . 人们把投资的波动性，风险当成了罚款，是需要避免的，而不是本身就需要的成本。 .",

Think of it like this, and one of the most powerful ways to increase your savings isn’t to raise your income. It’s to raise your humility. When you define savings as the gap between your ego and your income you realize why many people with decent incomes save so little.

People with enduring personal finance success—not necessarily those with high incomes—tend to have a propensity to not give a damn what others think about them. . 越在意自己的外在，越想要满足自己无尽的炫耀的需求，那存款也就相对越少。 . “Only saving for a specific goal makes sense in a predictable world.

Saving is a hedge against life’s inevitable ability to surprise the hell out of you at the worst possible moment.” . 存款是不可预知风险的对冲。 . “In a world where intelligence is hyper-competitive and many previous technical skills have become automated, competitive advantages tilt toward nuanced and soft skills—like communication, empathy, and, perhaps most of all, flexibility. If you have flexibility you can wait for good opportunities, both in your career and for your investments. You’ll have a better chance of being able to learn a new skill when it’s necessary. You’ll feel less urgency to chase competitors who can do things you can’t, and have more leeway to find your passion and your niche at your own pace. You can find a new routine, a slower pace, and think about life with a different set of assumptions. The ability to do those things when most others can’t is one of the few things that will set you apart in a world where intelligence is no longer a sustainable advantage. Having more control over your time and options is becoming one of the most valuable currencies in the world.” . 能有时间停下来，慢下来做选择是一种奢侈。不是每个人都有这样的奢侈。 .",

That’s all that happens.” The great art dealers operated like index funds. They bought everything they could. And they bought it in portfolios, not individual pieces they happened to like. Then they sat and waited for a few winners to emerge.” . 艺术品行业做的就像指数基金。 . “A lot of things in business and investing work this way. Long tails—the farthest ends of a distribution of outcomes—have tremendous influence in finance, where a small number of events can account for the majority of outcomes.” . Power law在投资中的体现，不仅是public market是这样，private market也是这样。推荐看看这篇关于天使投资回报的研究：https://www.angellist.com/blog/what-angellist-data-says-about-power-law-returns-in-venture-capital . Investment firm Correlation Ventures once crunched the numbers.²⁰ Out of more than 21,000 venture financings from 2004 to 2014: . 65% lost money. | Two and a half percent of investments made 10x–20x. | One percent made more than a 20x return. | Half a percent—about 100 companies out of 21,000—earned 50x or more. That’s where the majority of the industry’s returns come from. | . 这个数据也印证了power law . “Over the course of your lifetime as an investor the decisions that you make today or tomorrow or next week will not matter nearly as much as what you do during the small number of days—likely 1% of the time or less—when everyone else around you is going crazy.” . 在人生的所有选择中也是1%的选择起到了决定性的作用，其实就是几个瞬间的事。但平时如何武装自己去准备那些不知道什么时候需要去做的选择是人们能做的。这儿还提到了一个有意思的点，当别人都在做疯狂事情的时候，如何控制自己做符合逻辑的事，是真正的天才。 . “When we pay special attention to a role model’s successes we overlook that their gains came from a small percent of their actions. That makes our own failures, losses, and setbacks feel like we’re doing something wrong. But it’s possible we are wrong, or just sort of right, just as often as the masters are. They may have been more right when they were right, but they could have been wrong just as often as you. “It’s not whether you’re right or wrong that’s important,” George Soros once said, “but how much money you make when you’re right and how much you lose when you’re wrong.” . 当你做了正确的决定时，如何获取最大的收益也是非常关键的。这就有点像德州扑克，在关键手牌中，你拿着坚果，如何从第二坚果手中赢下最多的钱也很重要。另一个例子，如果你投的种子轮的公司有1个在A轮要被几家非常有名的VC投了，产品和利润增长都很可观，那是否使用pro rata rights追加投资就很重要了。 .",

            "content": "“Getting money requires taking risks, being optimistic, and putting yourself out there. But keeping money requires the opposite of taking risk. It requires humility, and fear that what you’ve made can be taken away from you just as fast. It requires frugality and an acceptance that at least some of what you’ve made is attributable to luck, so past success can’t be relied upon to repeat indefinitely.” . 打天下和守天下需要的是两种思维模式，如何做到自由地切换真的很难。 . “Not “growth” or “brains” or “insight.” The ability to stick around for a long time, without wiping out or being forced to give up, is what makes the biggest difference. This should be the cornerstone of your strategy, whether it’s in investing or your career or a business you own.” – Michael Moritz, the billionaire head of Sequoia Capital . 现在人们会被如何成功吸引，但”成功”之后如何保持不被踢出局是非常难的。 . “Say cash earns 1% and stocks return 10% a year. That 9% gap will gnaw at you every day. But if that cash prevents you from having to sell your stocks during a bear market, the actual return you earned on that cash is not 1% a year—it could be many multiples of that, because preventing one desperate, ill-timed stock sale can do more for your lifetime returns than picking dozens of big-time winners.” . 这段话其实蛮打动我的。我们投资的时候考虑放多少现金及等价物总是考虑收益率，感觉太低了（低于通膨），所以不愿意放过多的现金。一般美国的FA都是建议放5%~10%(除了紧急备用金外)。但作者说的如果现金太少导致很多时候你需要卖出股票来应急，那其实现金的收益率就不能只算纸面上的。 . “Many bets fail not because they were wrong, but because they were mostly right in a situation that required things to be exactly right. Room for error—often called margin of safety—is one of the most underappreciated forces in finance. It comes in many forms: A frugal budget, flexible thinking, and a loose timeline—anything that lets you live happily with a range of outcomes. It’s different from being conservative. Conservative is avoiding a certain level of risk. Margin of safety is raising the odds of success at a given level of risk by increasing your chances of survival. Its magic is that the higher your margin of safety, the smaller your edge needs to be to have a favorable outcome.” . 多给自己留一些放错的空间。这就和工作有些类似，也许你觉得你加加班1周能做完一件事，但防止有任何突发情况，在做计划的时候可以先预估两周。 . “Optimism is usually defined as a belief that things will go well. But that’s incomplete. Sensible optimism is a belief that the odds are in your favor, and over time things will balance out to a good outcome even if what happens in between is filled with misery.” . 乐观主义是相信长期来说事物向好的方向发展的可能性更大，虽然中间会有很多曲折。 . “A barbelled personality—optimistic about the future, but paranoid about what will prevent you from getting to the future—is vital.” . 对未来乐观但处处小心谨慎。记得有种杠铃投资法则，90%低风险(全球化的指数基金组合)+10%超高风险(VC, PE, Angel investing, start-ups)，对于90%的组合不需要你太多的精力，无论是涨还是跌，都不需要动，让复利和时间工作，对于10%的投资组合，需要你花大量的时间，因为其实就是一种赌博，需要投入时间研究来获得insights and edges。但无论是90%还是10%，都需要多元化，小额买入很多的资产，比如天使投资人不会把所有钱就压1家公司，一般种子轮的公司都会投个30~40家甚至更多，然后追加投资给胜出者。 .",

But the most powerful and important book should be called Shut Up And Wait. It’s just one page with a long-term chart of economic growth.” “You can’t blame people for devoting all their effort—effort in what they learn and what they do—to trying to earn the highest investment returns. It intuitively seems like the best way to get rich.” “But good investing isn’t necessarily about earning the highest returns, because the highest returns tend to be one-off hits that can’t be repeated. It’s about earning pretty good returns that you can stick with and which can be repeated for the longest period of time. That’s when compounding runs wild.” . 人们总是花费大量的精力追求一两次的高收益，而忽略了长期赚一个不错的不错的收益最终带来的成果。而且这还没有算短期极高的收益可能带来的悲剧的结局。 .",

History helps us calibrate our expectations, study where people tend to go wrong, and offers a rough guide of what tends to work. But it is not, in any way, a map of the future. A trap many investors fall into is what I call “historians as prophets” fallacy: An overreliance on past data as a signal to future conditions in a field where innovation and change are the lifeblood of progress.” . 这儿有两种比较对立的观点。一种说法是历史总是在重复上演，另一种是历史无法完全预测未来。我觉得第一种说法应该改一下，人类总是在重复同样的错误。我们既要从过去的经验中吸取经验教训，也要对现在和未来的情况有就事论事的观察，从而做出综合的判断。很多建立在过去的客观前提和假设的结论是无法直接应用在新的情景中的，最多有一些借鉴意义，但还是要因地制宜，而不是循规蹈矩。 . “The correct lesson to learn from surprises is that the world is surprising. Not that we should use past surprises as a guide to future boundaries; that we should use past surprises as an admission that we have no idea what might happen next.” . 承认极端的”黑天鹅“和异常事件、人物都是无法预测的。 . “What this means, in effect, is that all historical data going back just a few decades about how startups are financed is out of date. What we know about investment cycles and startup failure rates is not a deep base of history to learn from, because the way companies are funded today is such a new historical paradigm.” . 承接上面的观点，很多从数据中得出的经验和模式是基于过去的数据的。如果数据本身的模式就发生了变化，你还用过去的模型去预测未来，来注定是失败的。在数据科学领域有一句很著名的话: Gargage in Gargage out. . “But since economies evolve, recent history is often the best guide to the future, because it’s more likely to include important conditions that are relevant to the future.” . 这段让我想起了最近看的一个机器学习的例子，把一些久远的数据从训练集中删除，反而提高了最终模型的准确度。对于个人来说太过久远的经验可能会起到反作用，学会忘记很重要。 . “It comes from investor John Templeton’s view that “The four most dangerous words in investing are, ‘it’s different this time.’” Templeton, though, admitted that it is different at least 20% of the time. The world changes. Of course it does. And those changes are what matter most over time. Michael Batnick put it: “The twelve most dangerous words in investing are, ‘The four most dangerous words in investing are, ‘it’s different this time.’” . 这段话蛮好玩的。其实也就是表达历史是不是在重演的问题。 .",

It’s not rational, until you consider that investing is effectively giving money to strangers. If familiarity helps you take the leap of faith required to remain backing those strangers, it’s reasonable.” . 一个具体的案例，home bias虽然是一种偏见，但是合理的偏见，而且如果它能够克服让你推出市场的冲动，其实何尝不可接受这种偏见呢。 . “Day trading and picking individual stocks is not rational for most investors—the odds are heavily against your success. But they’re both reasonable in small amounts if they scratch an itch hard enough to leave the rest of your more diversified investments alone. ” . 另一个例子是说day trade和选个股是从道理上来说是不明智的。但只是花一小部分资金，满足你赌博的心理，那对于整体的投资组合来说又何尝不可。 .",

Perhaps they go hand in hand; wanting to surpass your peers can be the fuel of hard work. But life isn’t any fun without a sense of enough.

The talented employee may join a company because of its charismatic leaders, its generous benefits, and its world-class training programs, but how long that employee stays and how productive he is while he is there is determined by his relationship with his immediate supervisor. . 蛮赞同这句话的，但经理的好坏是很重要的因素之一，并不是唯一的因素，还有比如公司整体的文化，同事的水平和能力，个人的能力抱负与公司所能给予的平台的匹配程度都有关系。这儿就聊聊经理这一项，自己的感受是在Oracle做物联网云的时候在两年内有过4个经理： . 第一任经理因为相处的时间不长，而且我刚初出茅庐，所以唯一留下的印象能相信新人，并安排适当难度的任务和资源给我，让我快速上手建立信心 | 第二任经理相处的时间最长（后来成为了skip），他算是老江湖了，成为我经理的时候已经是Director等级了，所以对于技术细节已经多年不碰了，但成功的点在于新人团队的技术领袖，不会越权来看我们每天做了啥，更多的会争取资源，解决团队出现的问题比如需要延期的沟通等等。我对于他的印象是相对最多，也是最好的。有意思的是前阵子还给他内推了Facebook，说了很多好话。 | 第三任经理是第二个经理的手下，因为团队的扩大和重构，我就归到他手下了。有趣的是他是负责另一个Saas的，和我做的是sibling，但我其实还是和我原来的skip开会，原来的团队干活。第三个经历基本和我没啥沟通，除了一些签证身份的问题，基本没有交集，感觉就是挂个名负责一些我的日常（虽然也没有常规的1：1） | 第四任经理也是我skip的手下，她属于比较micromanagement，会盯着你做一些任务，会安排做一些面试之类的，但是其实也不是很懂技术，比较喜欢做项目管理之类的事。 总体来说Oracle的经理们没有给我留下很好的印象，至少我不会觉得我从他们身上学到了什么，或者给了我什么成长和支持。常规的一对一，职业发展的一些讨论，提供及时有效的反馈等等这些都是不存在的。而且本身也看不出技术的大局观，感觉基本是纯管理路线。反倒是在有限的几次和GVP接触，觉得他还是很有技术的sense，虽然可能对细节不懂，但很能点出关键点和可能的问题风险之类的，给我留下了蛮深的印象。 到了Facebook/WhatsApp后，3年一共经理3任经理： | 第一任经理接触的时间也不长，但他是整个团队的创始人，走技术流，大神级别的程序员，所有东西都是一手从0写出来的，所以在技术上有绝对的话语权。和他讨论过几次技术问题，前几次感觉不好接近，问了问题也得不到直接的回答（他的回答基本都是以他能理解的方式和我说，完全没考虑我的context）。其实这样的经理总体来说是一件坏事，虽然技术非常强，但是完全没有做经理的sense，不懂如果带团队，不懂得如果有效的激励和赋能。随着时间的推移，他逐渐发现了问题，也开始有所进步。 | 第二任经理是我刚加入的时候就确定要接手团队的，所以和他的互动是最多的。他技术也很强（和第一任是不同类型的），之前也是因为喜欢做技术，所以没有转经理路线。和他每周的一对一以及开会，总能把事情讲明白，对我技术成熟度上有很大的帮助。同时也非常愿意放手让我去做，并给我指引方向，提供很多及时的反馈。让我在短时间内有了长足的进步，还是很感谢有这样的经理的。 | 第三任，也就是现在的经理，风格和前两任也不相同。他的风格会比较坦率，比如我喜欢自己带团队做事，那他就会放手让我管技术，他只管人事，我每次对他的汇报他会仔细看，并且提出一些问题，看我是否能很好的回答，或是问我有没有什么地方需要他帮忙的，他也会对需要他比较深度介入的地方直接介入并提供有效的反馈。同时我感觉他虽然对于技术也很有热情，但成为经理后，不会直接插手技术的选型，而是旁敲侧击的提出问题，让技术领导者和团队成员去思考。他会更关注团队的文化，士气，成员的状态，团队未来的发展方向等等。 总结来说FB的经理总体素质上确实要比Oracle好很多，这和对经理的培训，很多领导团队的耳濡目染有关。经理们的第一目标是支持团队更好的工作，同时要求有技术能力(对于Software engineer manager需要IC6+才能转成经理，IC6基本等于阿里的P9)。 | .",

They’re the ones who must help individual contributors adjust to their first managerial job, and they must make sure that these neophyte managers value being managers. . The manager of managers的定义基本上是管manager的manager，有点上不着村(高层)，下不着店(Individual contributor)的意思。这个层级基本包含了Senior manager (M2), Director (D1)。这个层级的经理需要理解whole picuture (including business context, company long-term and short-term priority and strategy etc), 将他们映射到自己管理范围内的策略，因此也需要非常了解部门内的情况。我的理解是如果把一个公司比喻成一棵树，那CEO(以及CXO)是树根，是连接外部环境和内部环境的交互接口，提供生长的方向和营养；SVP/VP/Senior Director是主干支持各个不同的功能比如构建筛管导管，形成树皮保护自身，分泌激素等等，这个层级主要是把抽象的生长意向转化为每个大区功能的蓝图；到了Director，Senior Manager是分叉的交叉位置，支持小树枝(first-line manager)和树叶(IC)的工作，同时又要顾及到本功能区块的策略以及兼顾到整体树的健康发展比如有些部门就是需要被削减或者叫停。 .",

            "content": "Chapter 27: 月报 . I would like a monthly update from you that includes the key metrics for the business, as well as what you consider the wins and losses since the last email. I would like you to put requests for me and your other investors in the email as well. Every email should have how much cash you have left, your burn rate, and when you will be out of cash so that we can all plan for future raises. . “When you do get a new report, it’s wise to read it fully and send a short follow-up with some positivity for what’s working (“nice work landing that head of sales”) while being understanding about the losses (“Sorry you lost your CTO. Is there a job description I can share on LinkedIn?”). Depending on your related experience, there are always ways for you to be helpful. I like to pose these as questions, as opposed to edicts. For example, consider these two statements: “You need to do Facebook ads.” and “Have you considered doing Facebook ads?” . Chapter 28: 跟投与救急 . When founders from strong companies raise another round, they will simply let you know that they’ve found a new investor, hopefully a venture capitalist who also wants to join the board, and tell you “what the new terms are and ask if you want to take your pro rata. You will have a date by which to respond yea or nay to reinvest or get diluted by the new money coming into the company. This doesn’t happen too often, and when it does, you should spend as much time as possible figuring out what this new investor sees in your startup. If new money is willing to pay a higher price, it probably means you picked a winner and you might want to consider putting in another $100,000. If this was a $25,000 bet, you will be quadrupling down, and if you did this as a syndicate for $1,000, you will be, ummm, maybe hundred-upling?! Centupling. . When deciding to give a bridge, you need to have a candid talk with the founders about what the bridge will accomplish, typically by having them present some goals and what the startup will look like when this new tranche of capital comes in. “What you see here is a pattern. Founders believe that one magical event is going to save the startup, be it adding a feature or a team member or a customer. You have to ask yourself two questions when presented with this strategy. First, is it true that this one event will change their trajectory? Second, is it possible to reach that event given these additional resources? . Chapter 29: 心态、策略、成长、长期的眼光 . These days, when something blows up, I tend to move pretty quickly from an initial reaction of an “Oh fuck!” to an “Oh well” and then to “Okay, now let’s focus on what’s working.” It sucks to lose, but the more time and energy you put into your losses, the more you will feel like a loser. Instead, you should have been quadrupling down on your winners and spending more time on them. . If you’re constantly learning and working hard—two things that are in your control—good things will happen. This goes equally for founders and investors, which is why my reality show catchphrase is going to be “Do the work. . You don’t need to win every pot. You don’t need to win every day. You do need to win in the long term. Think about angel investing as a decadelong pursuit. . Chapter 30: 退出方式 . When an IPO happens, your previously illiquid shares, which lived on a spreadsheet at the company, are magically transferred into your E-Trade, Charles Schwab, or—ideally—Wealthfront account (see chapter 9; I’m an advisor). These shares are typically locked up for the first six months you own them, but after that “lockup period” you can do what you want with them. . A market for selling private company shares emerged. The reasons for this are (1) the perfect storm of private companies not wanting to go public too soon and (2) the availability of massive pools of private funds from private equity and late-stage venture capital firms wanting to own significant positions in those companies. . If you have a winner and it’s surging, it’s tough to sell knowing that your equity is likely to grow. But taking 10 or 20 or 30 percent of your winnings off your table at a high-enough price and putting it back into your portfolio will almost always help you sleep better. . The third, and most common way, an angel makes their money is when a startup is bought. There are three types of M&amp;A (merger and acquisition) deals: acquihires (a.k.a. fire sales), appropriate acquisitions, and premium sales. The term “acquihire” is a combination of “acquisition” and “hire,” and it’s what you call it when a big company buys a smaller company only to hire the entire team without doing a complete end run around the investors. When a startup gets acquihired, shareholders are likely to get back just pennies for every dollar they invested. . Chapter 31: 天使投资策略 . Remember, we have more blind spots than we do clear vision, so you must unlearn what you have learned to be a successful angel. . Some angels bet on founders. Some angels want to solve a problem. Some angels bet on delight. Some angels bet on markets. . Chapter 32：和成功者同行and do the work . Soak in what you’ve learned by hitting a home run in your first thirty bets while appreciating the randomness of life. You “didn’t exactly hit the lottery, but you did get lucky because your thirty bets probably weren’t all that different from the bets of people who lost money or broke even. In fact, almost all angels probably have a very similar return profile if you take out their top investment—and the exact same return profile if you take out their top three hits. . Life is random, but luck isn’t. Lucky people surround themselves with the most successful people in the world “and take chances. It isn’t hard or impossible. It just takes work. Do the work. Trust me, just do the work. .",

They also help you refine your selection ability in the future by reading your past deal memos to see what you got right and wrong. . Deal memo: Introduction, Deal, Competition, Hiring Plan, Key Risks, and a Recommendation. . Chapter 23: 不是不投，时候未到 . I would offer to let founders “take the red pill or blue pill” after they pitched me. In 100 percent of the cases, they took the red pill and asked me to tell them the unvarnished truth. I would then explain to them, founder to founder, exactly what I thought of their business, their product, and their pitch, plus how other investors would react to it. . These days, I am most likely to tell founders “not yet” when they ask me if I’m ready to invest. It’s an elegant phrase that Roelof Botha taught me and it works like a charm. In addition to telling them that I’m just not there yet, I let them know that I’d like for them to add me to their monthly updates. . Chapter 24: 天使投资的尽职调查 . Due diligence in early-stage investing is the voluntary act of looking into a business or individual before giving them your money. . Groupthink or perhaps even delusional thinking also tends to set in during investing, with people looking around the bargaining table at each other and thinking, “If nothing is scaring off those other three successful investors, then I’m not worried, either. I’m sure if something was wrong, one of them would have uncovered it. . During your founder meetings, you drill into a number of factual questions, getting more specific as you go. . People lie, to themselves and their investors and the world, but there is a difference between a factual lie (“We have Facebook and Google under contract!”) and a lofty mission (a.k.a. delusion) that if everything goes right, it just might turn into reality, like “We’re going to get to Mars” or “People lie, to themselves and their investors and the world, but there is a difference between a factual lie (“We have Facebook and Google under contract!”) and a lofty mission (a.k.a. delusion) that if everything goes right, it just might turn into reality, like “We’re going to get to Mars” or “We’re going to index the world’s information.” . Chapter 25: 第一次说“Yes” . You’re going to want to have a solid startup attorney review these documents for you, giving you a brief summary of the deal and calling out anything they feel is unusual. It will take an hour at most for an attorney to summarize a deal for you, and it’s well worth the cost. You should double-check that you have pro rata (see chapter 21). If it’s not in there, simply ask the founder to add it for you. They will almost universally do this without much fuss. . You should try to get a copy of the cap table if they’re willing to give it, as this gives you a very clear picture of who was involved in the round and how many shares each person owns. Over time, you’ll become good at reading these cap tables and decoding the investing strategies of other angel investors and venture capitalists. . Chapter 26: 创始人对待天使的态度 . Angels need you to crush it in order to have any chance of getting their money back and they will be your biggest cheerleaders. They love you and want you to succeed, so you shouldn’t hide from them or bend reality to what you think they want to hear. Be honest with us so we can help. . Additionally, remember that 80 or 90 percent of our investments fail, and we have to suffer through shutdown after shutdown. It’s depressing for us, especially in years two, three, and four of angel investing. . Send us monthly updates. Or twice a month. Fuck it, send a short weekly update if it’s concise—we want to help and we can’t help you if we aren’t up to speed. . First, as an angel, you need to document and fight for your rights. “Second, as the founder of a company, you should be on high alert when a new investor or an acquirer wants you to screw your earlier investors. If someone is willing to screw your early supporters, who helped you get to where you are today, what do you think they will do when your relationship hits a bump in the road? Exactly. .",

Tell me about the competition. | How do you make money? | How much do you charge customers? | How much does your average customer spend? | Tell me the top three reasons why this business might fail. | Example answers for AirBnb might be: . Hotels and HomeAway are our two biggest competitors. Hotels and HomeAway are both much more expensive—typically two to three times more expensive—than an Airbnb. | We take a transaction fee. | We take 3 percent from the host and charge a 10 percent fee from the guest. | Our average stay is 1.7 nights, with a total charge of $225, of which we keep about $40. | Regulations are our biggest challenge, finding inventory is our second-biggest challenge, and having a consistent, high-quality experience is our third-biggest challenge. | Chapter 20: 放弃是最常见创业失败的原因 . The number one reason a startup shuts down is not actually running out of money, which is what most people believe. The number one reason a startup fails is that the founder gives up. . Chapter 21: 投资已经有产品的公司与估值 . When you’re evaluating deals at the earliest stages of a startup’s life, there is not a lot of data to go on. You can put angel investing into two basic buckets: pre-traction and post-traction. . Pre-traction means the product doesn’t have users or revenue. In the pre-traction bucket, you will hear investors discuss startups in various phases of progress including, roughly from early to later: back of the napkin, basic research, business plan, mock-ups, functional prototype, MVP (minimum viable product), beta testing, and stealth mode. . Simply put, there are enough companies that have product/market fit, some traction, and some angel investors but need more capital to finish their mission. “Those are the startups you need to focus on with these first thirty angel investments. You want the people who are doing it, not the people talking about maybe doing it after you fund them. . Another great technique is to simply ask the founder, “Is that valuation set in stone?” and just listen. Perhaps they, like countless startups in the past, will come back to you in a couple of weeks, after their round didn’t materialize, and have a different number in mind. This is a marketplace and valuations can go up and down, but valuations are not as important as understanding who the other investors are, how the business is doing, who the customers are, and who’s on the team. .",

People want to meet with people who are fascinated by their vision, so take a moment to state why you think their vision is important and how you think you can help them achieve it—because they might just hit reply and introduce you to the founder. .

            "content": "Chapter 11: 天使联合会 (Angel Syndicate) . At these sites, successful angel investors create an investment group, or syndicate, where they explain what they typically invest in, what they’ve already invested in (their track record), how much they typically invest per deal (typically $10,000 to $100,000), and how much in “carry” they will charge you on a successful exit. Carry is short for “carried interest,” and it’s defined as the share of profits that go to the fund manager—in this case called the syndicate lead. . On these platforms, the syndicate leads typically take a 15 percent carry and the platform itself takes another 5 percent, for a total of a 20 percent carry. This is exactly how venture capital firms charge their own investors, who are called limited partners (LPs), with one critical difference: fees. . With angel syndicates, you simply pay the carry. There are no fees other than some minor legal and filing fees (typically less than $10,000 per deal, spread out across the dozens of investors in a deal). Individual angels like you can sign up for a syndicate (like mine) and make a nonbinding pledge to invest a small dollar amount per deal. On my syndicate, the minimum is $1,000, but most syndicates set this number at $2,500 to weed out the more casual investors. When a syndicate lead shares a deal, each of the syndicate members gets a chance to evaluate the deal via an online profile for that startup that typically includes a pitch deck and why the syndicate lead is investing. A syndicate normally negotiates an allocation with the founder of the startup, typically $200,000 to $500,000 (or 10 to 50 percent of a seed round). If the syndicate can pull together enough investment interest, the deal is consummated. That’s why I advocate that new angels do ten small angel syndicates before they start doing direct investing. Beyond the very real chance of getting a positive return on your investment, if you do this hack, you will build your reputation, have a chance to prove your worth to founders, and jump-start your network—all for the bargain price of $25,000. That’s only 20 percent of the cost of an MBA and you can do it in a month! . Syndicates require very little paperwork and you can choose to invest without taking any meetings or doing any due diligence. The only thing you need be able to do is prove that you’re an accredited investor here in the United States and have your wire transfer clear. . Chapter 12: 天使联合会基础 . I suggest looking for these basic characteristics: . A syndicate lead who has been investing for at least five years and has at least one notable, unicorn investment | A startup that is based in Silicon Valley | A startup that has at least two founders (with two, you have a backup in case one quits) | A startup that has a product or service that is already in the market (you’re not qualified to invest in startups that haven’t released their products—and frankly you don’t need to take this risk) | A startup that has either (a) six months of continuous user growth or (b) six months of revenue | A startup that has notable investors | A startup that, post-funding, will have eighteen months of cash remaining, commonly referred to as runway (ask the founder and syndicate lead how many months of runway they will have post-funding) | . If you love taking risks and don’t mind being locked up for a decade, I could see you putting 10 to 20 percent of your bankroll into angel investing. If you can tolerate risk, but don’t love it, and you can handle being illiquid for a decade, I could see you putting 5 percent of your bankroll into angel investing. If you’re going to be a great angel investor, start at the small tables while you learn—there is no rush. Every year, billion-dollar companies are created, and that will continue for the rest of our lives . For all ten of the startups you select, you need to write a “deal memo” explaining why you’re investing, what you think the risks are, and what you think has to go right for the startup to return money on your investment. . Syndicates are your Dagobah, a place where you can learn from other angel masters without losing a limb or your head. Go ahead and ask the syndicate lead why they are investing, meet with the founders, and talk to their customers—learn how to hold a lightsaber without cutting your fingers off. .",

            "content": "Chapter 1: 技术进步无可避免 . But I don’t invest in this future because I want to sit in an ivory tower laughing at people whose jobs are replaced. I invest in this future because it’s inevitable and I think I can help accelerate the efforts of the founders and innovators who are missionaries, not mercenaries. Of course, I plan to make a great deal of money in these revolutions, but I also plan to look back proudly and know that I helped propel changes that made our planet better. . Chapter 2: 赌一赌单车变摩托 . Now, gambling has a very negative connotation here in the West, but when I would spend all night playing poker in Los Angeles, with mostly old Asian men, I would frequently hear them say “No gamble, no future,” before pushing their chips into the pot, standing up, and rubbing their necks and heads furiously (a tic I soon acquired unconsciously). . Chapter 3: 天使投资101 . Angel investing is the act of putting money into the earliest investment rounds of a private business with the goal of getting back more money than you put in—much more than you can return in a safer, more established investment vehicle. . Chapter 4: 天使的四种能力 . The best angels in the world have four qualities, giving them the ability to (1) write a check (money), (2) jam out with the founders over important issues (time), (3) provide meaningful customer and investor introductions (network), and (4) give actionable advice that saves the founders time and money—or keeps them from making mistakes (expertise). . Chapter 5: 在硅谷投资 . Yes! . Chapter 6: 网络效应 . We live in a world full of network effects. The nodes in the network here in the Bay Area are the investors (angels, incubators, and venture capitalists), founders, service providers (colleges, lawyers, headhunters, and banks), and the talent pool (developers, designers, and marketers). . Chapter 7: 投资阶段 . sweat equity: It’s not an official round of funding. It’s the original creation of the business, and, unlike an investment round, the ownership here is paid for with the founders’ own sweat. | bootstrapping: A company with sweat equity has built its product or service based on the talents of its team, but a bootstrapped company might have had some outside help—but not from investors. For example, many times the founder of a startup will find a client who is willing to pay for a product that they built with sweat equity. | Friends and Family | Self-funding: When I meet someone who is going into debt to self-fund their startup I get worried—especially if they have a family. In my mind, if you have a family to take care of and you put them at risk to pursue a startup that you can’t build with sweat equity, bootstrapping, using your friends’ and family’s money, or raising money from a professional investor, you are, in all likelihood, insane. | Incubator funding: Most incubators will give founders $25,000 to $150,000 in seed funding for 5 to 10 percent of their startup. | Seed/Angel Funding: Most founders get their seed round by successfully completing two or three of the five early-stage funding strategies above. Essentially, your job as an angel is to monitor people coming out of these channels and pick out the best ones. | Bridge Round, a.k.a. Seed Plus: This round of funding typically comes from the same investors who did the seed round. Those investors are faced with losing their investment if they don’t continue to fund the startup, so they tend to be motivated to “close the bridge. What has changed since I made my original investment? | Serias A: The Series A is the most coveted and important round for a startup because it is typically done by a professional venture capital firm that will join the board and create proper “governance. Pro rata means you get to keep your percentage ownership in a company. Typically when you angel invest, you don’t get pro rata rights—unless you demand them, and then you do. | Series B, C, D, E, F, and Mezzanine Rounds: In fact, if your angel investment is starting to raise a Series B, C, D, or further rounds of financing, it’s probably time for you to consider selling some part of your stake in what’s called a “secondary” stock sale. | . Chapter 8: 创始人&lt;&gt;天使&lt;&gt;风险投资 . Now, in today’s modern age, I think the first $5 million you make is “take the edge off” money. You now have a decade of capital to rest on. However, when you break $10 million you have “escape velocity,” where you will never have to work again. The $500,000 in yearly interest you net should cover your expenses for a lifetime. However, when you get over $20 million, you’re in the “fuck you money” zone, where you can tell anyone to go fuck themselves. It’s a dangerous test of a founder’s resolve in my experience to go from being under the gun to being able to tell anyone who stands in your way to go make you a ham sandwich. VCs really don’t like to have founders get to “escape velocity” or “fuck you money”. . For angels, secondary shares are a wise way to “dollar cost average” your returns. If you have a chance to sell 25 percent of your position once or twice before the IPO, it would be wise to do so because we’ve all seen companies worth billions go to zero many, many, many times. . Being a founder is amazing because you get to build what you want to see in the world and you’re the “god-king/queen” at your company, but the odds are wildly against founders making a huge return, while the odds are in favor of a lifelong angel or venture capitalist getting rich. . Chapter 9: 机会成本 . How to allocate your finite time and energy efficiently is something you constantly have to revisit as an investor, founder, parent, and human being. The cost of not revisiting your allocation of time is great, leading to massive regret at having spent too much time on a startup, marriage, friendship, or investment that is destined to disappoint you or destroy your soul. . Chapter 10: 让自己幸运的方法 . It’s time for you to unplug from the Matrix and realize that you don’t need to pretend you’re rich by getting the premium channel package, and actually get rich by taking intelligent risks. . Even if the investments had failed, even if people had laughed at me calling myself an angel, even though I was only investing $500 at a time, I would have learned a heck of a lot and met a ton of entrepreneurial people. You can make your own luck in this life by putting yourself next to the people who are already winning. .",

This reminds me of my recent impulse of taking over some implementation work from others in order to speed things up. Actually, I shouldn’t do that due to the following reasons: . To be an IC6, it’s expected to design and/or implement the hardest parts of the system. The implementation I took over is actually not “the hardest part” of the project. | I usurpped my colleagues role of practicing the implementation who are commited to implement the most of API level functionalities. | There is other way to speed up the project. For example, I can take time to triage the issue to tell if it’s lack of competence or commitment from them. My feeling is the latter of lacking of commitment/motivation. Then, I should talk to them formally about my expectation, project timeline and see if they were occupied by other commitments. As the result, we should come up with the new target date for code completion and individual’s commitment e.g. how much time they will invest in this project.

Never Take Their Job Definitions for Granted Relying on assumptions and general job descriptions or following in the footsteps of the person who had the job before them will frequently lead to failure.

Let&#39;s first examine (&#39;Mankey&#39;, &#39;Primeape&#39;, 4) . Image.open((path/&quot;Mankey&quot;).ls()[0]) . Image.open((path/&quot;Primeape&quot;).ls()[0]) . The above two pokemon are quite similar to each other. From wiki) . it esolves from Mankey starting at level 28. . Let&#39;s take a look at another confusion pair:(&#39;Ponyta&#39;, &#39;Rapidash&#39;, 4) . Image.open((path/&quot;Ponyta&quot;).ls()[0]) . Image.open((path/&quot;Rapidash&quot;).ls()[0]) . It&#39;s another pair of evolution.From wiki) . It evolves from Ponyta starting at level 40 . Let&#39;s fine tune our model . First step, pick a more deeper model resnet34 and find a optimal learning rate . resnet34_learn = cnn_learner(dls, resnet34, metrics=error_rate) lr_min,lr_steep = resnet34_learn.lr_find() . Print out lr_min / 10, and lr_steep . print(f&quot;Minimum/10: {lr_min:.2e}, steepest point: {lr_steep:.2e}&quot;) . Minimum/10: 1.20e-02, steepest point: 1.10e-02 . In the learning rate plot, it appers that a learning rate around 1e-2 would be approriate, so let&#39;s choose that . lr=1e-2 . Second step, use the lr and manually train the last layer for several epochs (3). . resnet34_learn = cnn_learner(dls, resnet34, metrics=error_rate) resnet34_learn.fit_one_cycle(3, lr) . epoch train_loss valid_loss error_rate time . 0 | 2.437599 | 0.898877 | 0.222874 | 00:29 | . 1 | 1.162741 | 0.594926 | 0.159824 | 00:29 | . 2 | 0.522703 | 0.386840 | 0.096774 | 00:29 | . Then, we unfreeze the model so that we can train all the layers (including all pretrained layers by ImageNet dataset. Before that, we need to find better learning rate since we&#39;ve trained for 3 epochs. . resnet34_learn.unfreeze() . resnet34_learn.lr_find() . SuggestedLRs(lr_min=5.248074739938602e-06, lr_steep=6.309573450380412e-07) .

            "content": "Recently, I am taking a online deep learning course on fast.ai. The lesson 3 of the course is focusing on data ethics. The lecturer, Rachel Thomas, touches a few points that I echo back. Around 1:52:50, there is a short discussion . Q: Maybe the best way to incentivize ethical behavior it to tie financial or reputational risk to good behavior. In some ways, similar to how companies are now investing in cybersecurity because they don’t want to be the next Equifax. Can grassroots compaigns help in better ethical behaviors with regards to the use of AI? Rachel Thomas: …I think it’s hard for people to make the case to their boses of why they should be investing in cybersecurity. Particularly because cybersecurity is something that when it’s working well, you don’t notice it. … . Lots of things like cybersecurity that people are lacking of incentives/motivation to make an investment before something really bad happens to themselves. My personal experience is when designing a product (or running a service), many companies are eager to launch their product/service as early as possible with little test, and they call it “test it in production; move fast; quicker iteration beats fine-tuning”. In some cases, it will only lead to acceptable level of bad user experience while in others it could be devastating and turns out completely shutting down the business. Is there a good strategy to invest early before everything is to late? As mentioned above, it’s really hard to make the case unless it’s tied to financial/reputational risk, which is more close to a postmortem analysis after something bad happens. It’s easier to start this effort if the leadership team pocesses such mindset of prioritizing quality, privacy, security traits of their product/service, and building a culture around them. . Another point that hits me is around 2:05:52. I found the full version of interview and will quote here. . WHAT’S WRONG WITH AI Julia Angwn: I strongly believe that in order to solve a problem, you have to diagnose it, and that we’re still in the diagnosis phase of this. If you think about the turn of the century and industrialization, we had, I don’t know, 30 years of child labor, unlimited work hours, terrible working conditions, and it took a lot of journalist muckraking and advocacy to diagnose the problem and have some understanding of what it was, and then the activism to get laws changed. I feel like we’re in a second industrialization of data information. I think some call it the second machine age. We’re in the phase of just waking up from the heady excitement and euphoria of having access to technology at our fingertips at all times. That’s really been our last 20 years, that euphoria, and now we’re like, “Whoa, looks like there’re some downsides.” I see my role as trying to make as clear as possible what the downsides are, and diagnosing them really accurately so that they can be solvable. That’s hard work, and lots more people need to be doing it. It’s increasingly becoming a field, but I don’t think we’re all the way there. . Dianosing and understanding the full picture of the problem is not an easy problem. It takes non-trivial time to identify the exact problem and serves as the starting point of crafting potential solution. On the one hand, if we don’t fully understand the problem, it may cost way more time and resource to pivot. On the other hand, we can’t spend endless time on diagnosing a problem, it’s not pratical in reality and we never make any progress to exercise some potential solutions to test our understanding. It’s always a evolving and dynamic process that we put enough time ahead to understand the problem, then design solution and test it, measure the results to create a feedback loop to adjust the initial understanding and design a better solution. .",

A hallmark of wisdom is knowing when it’s time to abandon some of your most treasured tools and some of the most cherished parts of your identity. . 旧瓶装新酒，是相当常见的，比如一个商业模式可以用到新的行业。新瓶装旧酒，其实也就是改革，相对来说难以以无痛（低痛）的方式来实现，比如旧的商业模式已经不开始限制公司的发展，那么需要开始使用新的商业模式，那如何一步一步替代旧的模式和业务，让大家信服新的商业模式的有效性，如何调整组织人员，甚至改变文化以适应新的模式，这些都需要不断的调整试错，在某些特殊情况下甚至得面对更高烈度的“阵痛”来实现。这也是为什么新的创业公司能够击败曾经的王者的原因，庞大的身躯有时候是商业的护城河，有时候确实拖累企业适应新的趋势的负担。对于一个人来说也是一样，当你在一个领域做得足够好，足够高的时候，要思考的是如何能够放下一个领域带来的思想枷锁，甚至要放下所有去探索其他的方向或是领域。其实这也印证了易经乾卦的“九五，飞龙在天。上九，亢龙有悔”的道理。 .

And it is naturally self-correcting as a whole, though not necessarily for its parts. For example, if there is too much supply and waste in a market, prices will go down, companies will go out of business, and capacity will be reduced until the supply falls in line with the demand, at which time the cycle will start to move in the opposite direction. Similarly, if an economy turns bad enough, those responsible for running it will make the political and policy changes that are needed or they will not survive, making room for their replacements to come along. These cycles are continuous and play out in logical ways and they tend to be self-reinforcing. . I believe that every entity needs to focus on evolving (or they will die out), making connection with the world while consuming input from it and producing output to it. It’s similar to a dot on a huge net, without connecting to other dots, it’s a an island, it never grows or influences other dots. . Why blogging .

            "content": "The following are quoted from a fast.ai notebook (04_mnist_basics) discussing Tenacity and Deep Learning. I want to share some reflection on this “touching” anecdote. . The story of deep learning is one of tenacity and grit by a handful of dedicated researchers. After early hopes (and hype!) neural networks went out of favor in the 1990’s and 2000’s, and just a handful of researchers kept trying to make them work well. Three of them, Yann Lecun, Yoshua Bengio, and Geoffrey Hinton, were awarded the highest honor in computer science, the Turing Award (generally considered the “Nobel Prize of computer science”), in 2018 after triumphing despite the deep skepticism and disinterest of the wider machine learning and statistics community. Geoff Hinton has told of how even academic papers showing dramatically better results than anything previously published would be rejected by top journals and conferences, just because they used a neural network. Yann Lecun’s work on convolutional neural networks, which we will study in the next section, showed that these models could read handwritten text—something that had never been achieved before. However, his breakthrough was ignored by most researchers, even as it was used commercially to read 10% of the checks in the US! In addition to these three Turing Award winners, there are many other researchers who have battled to get us to where we are today. For instance, Jurgen Schmidhuber (who many believe should have shared in the Turing Award) pioneered many important ideas, including working with his student Sepp Hochreiter on the long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture (widely used for speech recognition and other text modeling tasks, and used in the IMDb example in «chapter_intro»). Perhaps most important of all, Paul Werbos in 1974 invented back-propagation for neural networks, the technique shown in this chapter and used universally for training neural networks (Werbos 1994). His development was almost entirely ignored for decades, but today it is considered the most important foundation of modern AI. There is a lesson here for all of us! On your deep learning journey you will face many obstacles, both technical, and (even more difficult) posed by people around you who don’t believe you’ll be successful. There’s one guaranteed way to fail, and that’s to stop trying. We’ve seen that the only consistent trait amongst every fast.ai student that’s gone on to be a world-class practitioner is that they are all very tenacious. . It’s indeed a great story about tenacity and grit. I ask myself: If most of my peers were standing on the other side, could I still firmly hold on to my position and prove their validness? Unfortunately, I can’t give a postive answer. People are mostly social animal, we need to be supported, loved and believed by our peers. Otherwise, our lives are in a danger if abandoned by our “tribe”. Taking the alternative path and be the minorities needs tremendous courage and belief that the truth rests on their side. I don’t think it’s always worthing the correctness our beliefs and/or ideas and win the battle of argument every time. For example, when you and your partner have different opinions, there is no need to convince them you are the right one. If your parner is reasonable person or the issue may lead to consequences you can’t bear, then the strategies to reach the agreement are another story. . Another point is as a learner of deep learning, we should catiously pace of our learning, not too fast and not too slow. If we go through all the material too fast, we pay less attention on the key components which may backfire when we try to go deeper into the area. Building a solid foundation, especially learning stuff you have no exposure before, is a smart strategy in order to go fast in the future. If we move too slow, we may lose interests because we are making enough progress to get feedbacks. For example, if I spend a whole month figuring out every nitty gritty details of math and library details of fast.ai, I won’t feel any excitement and may eventually drop the class. The course structure is well designed by fast.ai team adopting a top-down approach to grasp the whole picture of deep learning, train some state-of-the-art models solving real life problem in lession 1 &amp; 2 and intentionally leave out math and other coding details. .",

            "content": "This is mostly inspired by a fast.ai MOOC: Practical Deep Learning for Coders.It used a top-down approach teaching the deep learning. Lesson 1 and 2 will directly build several the state of the art deep learning models by a few lines of code. . In this notebook, my goal is to train a model to tell the difference of my cat: Albus, a silver shaded british shorthair from all other british short hairs. There is little pratical utility of the model, though it can be extended to something like pet finder using cameras including CCTVs, phone&#39;s camera etc to help people find their missing pet. . As a reader, you just need some basic understanding of python (or similar) and really limited experience of coding such as variable assignment, import libraries, calling some functions. I will explain every step in this notebook of what it&#39;s achieving. . Import your libraries . This is some basic python code import fastai/fastbook libraries (built by fast.ai team) to your jupyter notebook so that you can use all classes, functions in the libraries. One thing you might notice, it&#39;s generally a bad habit to import *, but according to fast.ai mooc, they pay extra attention on this, and it only imports necessary artifacts into the notebook, so you don&#39;t have to worry to much about it. . from fastbook import * from fastai.vision.widgets import * . Prepare your data . In this step, it will prepare your training data. . For my pet Albus, I upload around 150 pictures into a folder british_shorthair/albus. | For the not_albus part, I use bing image search API to find around 150 silver shaded british shorthair images and download them into british_shorthair/albus.

You will be given a key, which you can copy and enter in a cell as follows (replacing &#39;XXX&#39; with your key and executing it)3.

Train your model . In the following code cell, it only contains 4 lines of code but it does quite a lot: . Line 1: It prepares your data for training your model. It returns a DataBlock which is a fast.ai class blocks=(ImageBlock, CategoryBlock): It tells datablock that the input data is image and label is category | get_items=get_image_files: it means when loading input item, it will use get_image_files function to load the data | splitter=RandomSplitter(valid_pct=0.2, seed=42): it means that a randomation split will be performed to split your data into training (80%) and validation (20%). Seed will guarantee everytime it does a separation, the result will be the same. | get_y=parent_label: it teams when load label, it will find the image&#39;s parent folder name as the label name, which is a common way to organize the data | item_tfms=RandomResizedCrop(224, min_scale=0.5): It applies item-wise transformation, which randomly resize and crop you image with size 224 px and minimum 50% of original image. | batch_tfms=aug_transforms(): It&#39;s using image augmentation technics to transform batch of images. It will flip, twist, adjust different stats of your images to generate &quot;new&quot; images for training purpose so that model can learn from different perspectives. | | Line 2: It loads the actual data from your path | Line 3: We use a cnn learner with our data, and resnet18 architecture and use error rate as our metrics. The architecture in our case is not supper important and it&#39;s a deep residual network pretrained on imagenet (more on https://pytorch.org/hub/pytorch_vision_resnet/). For error rate, you will see that at each epoch (iteration) of training, what percentage of images that model makes mistake predict the correct label on validation set. | Line 4: it uses transfer learning technics and you don&#39;t need to train the model from scatch. Instead, you just need to call fine tune for 4 epochs on your training data which saves us a lot of time and reduces the requirements on the number of images we need to train a good model. | # Using transfer learning tactic since I don&#39;t have enough albus picture to train british_sh = DataBlock( blocks=(ImageBlock, CategoryBlock), get_items=get_image_files, splitter=RandomSplitter(valid_pct=0.2, seed=42), get_y=parent_label, item_tfms=RandomResizedCrop(224, min_scale=0.5), batch_tfms=aug_transforms() ) dls = british_sh.dataloaders(silver_british_shorthair_path) learn = cnn_learner(dls, resnet18, metrics=error_rate) learn.fine_tune(4) . epoch train_loss valid_loss error_rate time . 0 | 1.217437 | 3.258252 | 0.425926 | 00:18 | . epoch train_loss valid_loss error_rate time . 0 | 0.540694 | 1.086071 | 0.388889 | 00:19 | . 1 | 0.425827 | 0.172585 | 0.055556 | 00:18 | . 2 | 0.306371 | 0.045891 | 0.037037 | 00:18 | . 3 | 0.277176 | 0.029750 | 0.000000 | 00:19 | . Checkout how your model perform . This section helps you quick understand how your model perform by showing confusion matrix: compare the model prediction against the actual label. As we can see, our model is pretty good at predicting albus! . interp = ClassificationInterpretation.from_learner(learn) interp.plot_confusion_matrix() . Export you model . This step is not necessary if you don&#39;t want to use your model anywhere else. However, if you do, exporting your model to the pickle format and loading it at somewhere else e.g. your web server, mobile app is really easy way to use your model. . learn.export(&#39;albus-detector.pkl&#39;) . Make predictions . I prepare some test data (which model never sees in training as well as in validation sets) to see if model can actually predict on those images. As the result, for two cases, it predicts correct answer. However, you can prepare more test data to evaluate your model! . print(learn.predict(&#39;albus_test/IMG_20190328_193913.jpg&#39;)) print(learn.predict(&#39;albus_test/not_albus_1.jpeg&#39;)) .

            "content": "There are six leadership passages that a leader needs to go through. The book focuses on helping readers become familiar with the skills, time applications, and work values demanded by each passage, as well as this particular leadership gestalt. . Passage One: From Managing Self to Managing Others . Manageing self: They contribute by doing the assigned work within given time frames and in ways that meet objectives. By sharpening and boardening their individual skills, they make increased contributions and are then considered “promotable” by organizations. From a time application standpoint, the learning involves planning (so that work is completed on time), punctuality, content, quality, and reliability. The work values to be developed include acceptance of the company culture and adopting of professional standards. | Managing others: The skills people should learn at this first leadership passage include planning work, filling jobs, assigning work, motivating, coaching, and measuring the work of others.They must shift from “doing” work to getting work done through others. They must believe that making time for others, planning, coaching, and the like are necessary tasks and are their responsibility. More than that, they must view this other-directed work as mission-critical to their sucess. Passage Two: From Managing Others to Managing Managers . Perhaps the biggest difference from the previous passage is that here, managers must be pure management. Now they need to divest themselves of individual tasks. The key skills that must be mastered duration this transition include . | Selecting people to turn Passage One | Assigning managerial and leadership work to them | Measuring their progress as managers | Coaching them | Beginning to think beyond their function and concerning themselves with strategic issues that support the overall business One of the touch responsibility of managers of managers is to return people to individual-contributor roles if first-line managers don’t shift their behaviors and values Passage Three: From Managing Managers to Functional Manager . | Skills: New communication skills with individual contributors | Endeavor to understand areas that are outside their own experiences and also learn to value it | Team play with other functional managers and competition for resources based on business needs | Proficient strategiest, not only for their function but also for blending their functional strategy with the overall business strategy. | . | Time-application: Participating in business team meetings and working with other functional managers | Delegating responsibility for overseeing many functional tasks to direct reports | . | Value Long-term strategy, such as state-of-the-art, futuristic thinking for their function, is usually what gives most managers trouble. Passage Four: From Functional Manager to Business Manager . | . | Receive significant autonomy | In charge of integrating functions | From looking at plans and proposals functionally to a profit perspective and to a long-term view | Balancing act between future goals and present needs and making trade-offs between the two Passage Five: From Business Manager to Group Manager . | Similar managing self to managing others, a business manager values the success of his own business while a group manager values the success of other people’s businesses. | Evaluating strategy for resource allocation and deployment purposes. | Development of business managers | Portfolio strategy: Do I have the right collection of businesses? What to add, subtract and change? | Avoid wishful thinking and instead taking a hard, objective looking at their range of resources and making a judment based on analysis and experience. Passage Six: From Group Manager to Enterprise Manager . | Long term visionary thinkers | Develop operating mechanisms to know and drive quarter-by-quarter performance that is in tune with longer-term strategy. | Well-developed external sensitivity and the ability to manage external constituencies, sense significant external shifts, and do something about them proactively. | Let go of the pieces - that is, the individual products and customers - and focus on the whole | Assume a team of high-achieving and ambitious direct reports. | .",

            "content": "吃老本 . 前一篇聊了成为技术管理者后，不免会在技术上有所退步，我们首先要接受这个事实。那接受后是不是就可以安心地吃老本呢，当然不是。在现金这个社会，只需要一两年，甚至更短的时间内技术就会迭代，一年前火热的框架，可能在今年就会被另一套技术或是框架所替代。作为技术管理者，除非你在成为技术管理者前已经有大量的沉淀，对各种技术融汇贯通，否则老本真没几年好吃。 . Why/How/What . 那既然技术迭代得那么快，而管理者又不可能完全专注于技术上，那么就要着眼于顶层的架构，能够对自己领域内的系统的不同设计回答why, how和what。why其实是最重要的，核心是回答一个系统服务于解决一个什么现实中的问题，就比如消息队列是一种服务间的异步通讯方式，主要解决不需要同步（即时性）的操作的请求和应答。how是回答为了实现这个功能，从meta层面如何设计这个系统，这儿有一个比较好用的判断标准，你能不能在10分钟（甚至5分钟）就把这个系统的设计思路给一个有一定技术背景但没有结束过你的系统的人讲清楚系统是怎么运作的，并谈谈其关键指标，不同设计的优劣与分别适用于怎么样的场景、需求。这儿还是以消息队列来举例，最经典的kafka的模型，producer -&gt; broker/queue -&gt; consumer，一个或多个producer发送消息到broker的某个topic，一个或多个consumer可以订阅broker的topic来获得更新，这就是最基础的how。what注重于细节设计，注重一个系统里每个子系统的设计与实现，了解的深度可以更加因地制宜，但一些关键点还是需要知道的。比如消息队列中broker的persistent策略，consumer如何确保不会漏消系，遇到重复的消息应该怎么处理等等。 . Priority . 一个技术型公司当技术团队超过50人后一线技术管理者需要更了解how和what，而更高层级的管理者的应该更偏重why和how，放手what。这儿举个WhatsApp的例子，当WhatsApp在被FB收购前还只有10~30人左右的工程师团队时，每个人都非常hands on，也没有什么一线技术管理，只有工程师，一个工程师负责一大块的功能。当被收购后慢慢团队到了50-100人，就开始出现技术管理，这个阶段没有太多的层级，所以每个manager其实也还是输出一定代码的。后期发展到几百人的团队，不同的国家都有团队时，一线manager就不会再输出太多代码了（偶尔会有一些，因人而异），而senior manager及以上更多地就会注重why，how并且challenge手下一些what的问题，来获得二手的信息。 .",

            "content": "保持技术敏感度：为什么想要分享这个话题 . 想做成一个系列的分享，第一篇就写写为什么会想要分享这个话题。 管理者不是天生就是在管理的位置上，都会经过一份或者几分技术类的工作 (当然这里说的技术适用于很多领域比如市场，产品，销售等等，不仅仅是计算机相关的技术。当然因为我本身是做IT的，所以会以IT技术为例做分享)，最终成为一个管理者的。当然第一份工作就是创业的话会有一些些的不同，但即使你是创始人之一，也是同时在做技术类和管理类的工作。当一个人成为了管理者后，就会面对一个问题，你的主要职责是支持你的团队，以团队为你的最高优先级做出成绩。很多新的管理者，之前有着很出色的技术，会习惯于还在一线干活，或者还非常深入的参加技术层面的设计。很多国内的公司对于一线管理者的要求也是即负责技术也负责管理。这就对一线管理者提出了更高的要求，你既要懂技术，也要能带团队。一个人的时间是有限的，你不可能还像原先一样团身心的投入在技术层面，那怎么样能够保持技术能力、敏感度，又不耽误管理的任务呢。 在第一篇的最后，说一个Google/Facebook在管理者上的一个演变，当Google、Facebook还相对较小时，有一种Technical Lead Manager (TLM) 的职位，就是像上面所提到的你既要负责技术方向，也要带团队，甚至偶尔还要撸起袖子写代码(当团队处于紧急状态时)。而当公司渐渐成长了之后TLM越来越稀少，公司也越来越不鼓励成为TLM，TLM的职位被拆分成了Engineering Mangager (EM)和Tech Lead (TL, IC5+ engineer)，EM和TL往往要合作，一个偏重于团队，一个偏重于技术，但TL也要动一些管理，EM也要能理解现有技术，趋势和评价可行性等(可以不懂一些细节)。我认为一方面是公司大了，自然分工会更明确，在单方面集中精力自然会做的比同事兼顾多方面来的更好，但对于EM来说，尤其是空降的EM，会对技术方面也有要求，而往往管理的技术可以通用，但是技术不一定通用，如何快速了解团队的技术就成了一个大问题。 .",

            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) .

            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code .

My interests lay in technology (e.g. DL, distributed system), leadership/management, self-improvement (both physically and mentally), investment (I am a believer of index investing). I also picked some topics that are not usually shown in my book list like philosophy, history. I also enjoy playing games. My favorite games are no limit texas hold’em, kingdom rush, and Zelda breath of the wild. For the kingdom rush one, I used to run my bilibili channel, and if you also enjoy this game, check it out! .",
