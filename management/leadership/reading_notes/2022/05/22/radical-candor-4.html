<meta name="description" content="“Challenging others and encouraging them to challenge you helps build trusting relationships because it shows 1) you care enough to point out both the things that aren’t going well and those that are and that 2) you are willing to admit when you’re wrong and that you are committed to fixing mistakes that you or others have made. But because challenging often involves disagreeing or saying no, this approach embraces conflict rather than avoiding it. Former Secretary of State Colin Powell once remarked that being responsible sometimes means pissing people off. 4 You have to accept that sometimes people on your team will be mad at you. In fact, if nobody is ever mad at you, you probably aren’t challenging your team enough. The key, as in any relationship, is how you handle the anger. When what you say hurts, acknowledge the other person’s pain. Don’t pretend it doesn’t hurt or say it “shouldn’t” hurt—just show that you care. Eliminate the phrase “don’t take it personally” from your vocabulary—it’s insulting. Instead, offer to help fix the problem.”" />

<p>当提出表扬或是问题时，我们需要承认会对对方的情感造成影响，但不能因为害怕对对方的情感造成伤害，就不去提出问题，而是应该帮助他去解决问题。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“WE TALKED ABOUT the importance of humility. Radical Candor is not a license to be gratuitously harsh or to “front-stab.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>当然Radical candor不是说你可以不考虑方式地去说。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Radical Candor is also not an invitation to nitpick. Challenging people directly takes real energy—not only from the people you’re challenging but from you as well. So do it only for things that really matter. A good rule of thumb for any relationship is to leave three unimportant things unsaid each day.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Radical Candor is not a hierarchical thing. To be Radically Candid, you need to practice it “up,” “down,” and “sideways.” Even if your boss and peers have not bought in to this method, you CAN create a Radically Candid microcosm for yourself and the people on your team. You are entitled to proceed with a little more caution with your boss and your peers. But ultimately, if it’s not possible to be Radically Candid with your boss and your peers, I’d recommend finding a different kind of work environment if at all possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Radical candor也不是鸡蛋里挑骨头。同时也要对上级，平级和下级都保持Radical candor（当然要注意方法）。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“BOTH DIMENSIONS OF Radical Candor are sensitive to context. They get measured at the listener’s ear, not at the speaker’s mouth. Radical Candor is not a personality type or a talent or a cultural judgment. Radical Candor works only if the other person understands that your efforts at caring personally and challenging directly are delivered in good faith.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>很多人觉得自己好心提醒，为什么对方就是不接受，甚至要反击。可能是没有注意方式方法，如果你提出的意见对方不接受，那本身就是没有效果的，不管你是不是真正关心以及处于好心，得想办法让对方知道你是出于好心，并且用对方能够接受和理解方式让他明白你的用意</p>
