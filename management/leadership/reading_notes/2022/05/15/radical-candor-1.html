<p>一个团队既需要有稳定的输出者Rock star，也需要有成长型的人Super star。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“At Apple, as at Google, a boss’s ability to achieve results had a lot more to do with listening and seeking to understand than it did with telling people what to do; more to do with debating than directing; more to do with pushing people to decide than with being the decider; more to do with persuading than with giving orders; more to do with learning than with knowing.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>团队的领导者更多要倾听而不是发号施令，更多的讨论和引导大的方向而不是所有决定都要经手，尽可能多的去说服而不是命令，更多地去学习而不是满足于已经知道的。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“No, the reason why Silicon Valley turned out to be a good place to study the relationships between bosses and the people who report to them is that the war for “talent” there is intense . So many great companies in the Valley are growing and hiring that there’s no reason to stay with a company if you are unhappy or think your potential is being wasted. And there’s certainly no reason to pay the “asshole tax.” If you don’t like your boss, you quit, knowing that ten other companies will be lining up to hire you. So the pressure on companies to get these relationships right is enormous.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>硅谷之所以对人才的福利和待遇好，一个很重要的原因是，这儿有太多的机会可以让人才挑选。其实另一个点是，技术密集型的产业更注重的是创新，而不是提高单位时间的产量，创造性的工作不是靠严格的作息得来的。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“ If you lead a big organization, you can’t have a relationship with everybody. But the relationships you have with your direct reports will impact the relationships they have with their direct reports. The ripple effect will go a long way toward creating—or destroying—a positive culture. Relationships may not scale, but culture does.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>这种涟漪效应是很重要的，CTO强调的事和文化会通过一层一层传到一线员工，公司奖励什么样的行为，员工就会怎么去做。</p>
