<p>我们现在的周会都会列出对better engineering相关的贡献，因为是infra组，所以强调这方面的贡献还是很有必要的，这样大家会更有动力，并知道做相关的项目会得到好的回报（至少和新feature差不多）。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Why do I list coaching as a bonus? It’s not always a core need for doing the job well, and there will be many times when you don’t have either the qualifications or the capability to provide the coaching that everyone on your team needs. Coaching is most important for your early-career team members, or those who have the potential or desire for advancement. Many people will be content with doing the job they know how to do well, and as long as they are doing it well enough, it’s not a good use of your time to try to coach them. Save your valuable coaching time for those who are receptive to it.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>这段话很关键，不是所有人都想要升职或者提高技能的，这个和radical candor一书里的super star (steep growth trajectory+excellent performance at the current position)和rock star (gradual growth trajectory+excellent performance at the current position)很类似。作为经理你也不可能全能,对于相对经验比较少的人可以提供一定的指导。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Try to account for the whole year, not just the past couple of months
This will be easier if you keep notes on what has happened with each person throughout the year. One tactic is to keep a running summary of your 1-1s, including any feedback that was delivered. If you haven’t done this, I encourage you to look through your email to remember which projects launched, review what activities were happening month by month, and put yourself back into the perspective of that time period. The goal for viewing the whole year is to recognize not just early accomplishments but also the growth and change you’ve seen since then.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>做review不是年底的事，平时就要记录。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“If you can’t use a concrete example to support a point, ask yourself if the point is something you should be communicating in the review. Forcing yourself to be specific will steer you away from writing reviews based on underlying bias.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>不要仅仅靠记忆或者感觉。要提供具体的事实，没有的话就去找，找不到就不要写这点。</p>
