<meta name="description" content="“So, yes, shielding your teams from distraction is important. Or, to put it another way, helping them understand the key important goals and focusing them on those goals is important. However, it’s unrealistic to expect that you can or should shield your team from everything. Sometimes it’s appropriate to let some of the stress through to the team. The goal is not to stress them out, but to help them get context into what they’re dealing with. The extreme shielders think they can best focus and motivate their teams by giving clear goals. But humans usually need some sort of context into why these goals have been set, and thereby into what problems they’re working to solve. If you’re going to have operational issues in November if a particular system isn’t up and running, your team deserves to understand that consequence. Appropriate context is what helps teams make good decisions about how and where to focus their energy. As the manager, it’s not your job to make all of those decisions by yourself.”" />

</blockquote>

<p>要把握一个度，给团队提供足够的上下文的同时不要让团队承受过大的压力，让团队知道为什么要做一个项目，让他们更好地去决定怎么做，而不是所有决定都你自己做（可以做一些大方向的决定）。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“You may be a shield, but you are not a parent. Sometimes, in combining the roles of shield and mentor we end up in a parenting-style relationship with our team, and treat them like fragile children to be protected, nurtured, and chided as appropriate. You are not their parent. Your team is made up of adults who need to be treated with appropriate respect. This respect is important for your sanity as well as for theirs. It’s too easy to take their mistakes personally when you view them as a child-like extension of yourself, or to get so emotionally invested that you take every disagreement they have with you personally.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>团队都是成年人，不要把经理的职责和父母的职责搞混，正常的以成年人的方式沟通，给到足够的关心，但不是宠溺，也是要给足够的压力的。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“You have more responsibility than you may expect. While the product manager is responsible for the product roadmap, and the tech lead is responsible for the technical details, you are usually accountable for the team’s progress through each of these elements. The nature of leadership is that, while you may only have the authority to guide decisions rather than dictate them, you’ll still be judged by how well those decisions turn out.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Create a Data-Driven Team Culture: These efficiency and technical data points can be used to evaluate decisions on both product features and technical changes.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Flex Your Own Product Muscles: Developing customer empathy will also help you figure out which areas of the technology have the greatest direct impact on your customers, and that understanding will guide where you invest engineering effort.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Look into the future: You need to think two steps ahead, from a product and technology perspective. Getting a sense of where the product roadmap is going helps you guide the technical roadmap. Many technical projects are supported on the strength of their ability to enable new features more easily”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Review the Outcome of Your Decisions and Projects: Talk about whether the hypotheses you used to motivate projects actually turned out to be true. Was it true that the team moved faster after you rewrote that system? Did customer behavior change in the way the product team predicted when you added the new feature? What have you learned from your A/B tests? It’s easy to forget to review assumptions after the project is done, but if you make this a habit for yourself and your team, you’ll always learn from your decisions.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Run Retrospectives for the Processes and Day-to-Day: Whether you work in an agile methodology or some other fashion, the regular process retrospective has a lot of value for detecting patterns and forcing a reckoning with the outcome of decisions. Is the team feeling good about how they get requirements? Do they feel good about the code quality? This process helps you learn how the decisions you make over time affect the way your team operates in the day-to-day. This approach is more subjective than gathering data about the team’s health, but it’s arguably even more valuable than many objective measures, because it comes from the things the team itself is noticing and struggling with or celebrating.”</p>
