<meta name="description" content="“It will get better. But of course it won’t get better all by itself. So stop and ask yourself: how , exactly, will it get better? What are you going to do differently? What will the person in question do differently? How might circumstances change? Even if things have gotten a little better, have they improved enough? If you don’t have a pretty precise answer to those questions, it probably won’t get better. Somebody is better than nobody . Another common reason why bosses are reluctant to fire a poor performer is that they don’t want a “hole” on the team. If you fire “Jeffrey,” who will do the work he was doing? How long will it take you to find a replacement? The fact is that poor performers often create as much extra work for others as they accomplish themselves, because they leave parts of their job undone or do other parts sloppily or behave unprofessionally in ways that others must compensate for. Steve Jobs put it succinctly, if harshly, when he said, “It’s better to have a hole than an asshole.” A transfer is the answer. Because firing people is so very hard, it’s often tempting to instead pass them off to an unsuspecting colleague at your company, even if they don’t have skills your colleague needs or are a poor cultural fit. It feels “nicer” than firing them. This is obviously not so nice for the unsuspecting colleague and is generally a mistake for the person you’re trying to be “nice” to as well. It’s bad for morale. It’s also tempting to tell yourself that you’re not firing somebody because doing so would discourage the team. But keeping someone on who can’t do the job is far worse for morale—yours, the person who’s doing a crummy job, and everyone else who’s doing a great job. Again, this comes down to having built a good relationship with the person you’re firing, and the rest of the team. It comes back to having demonstrated that you care personally.”" />

<p>不裁员的幻想说的很有道理。尤其是觉得只要给时间，对方会变好，以及担心有人走了他的工作谁来做。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“If you want your team to achieve something bigger than you could achieve alone, if you want to “burst the bounds of your brain,” you have to care about the people you are working with. You’ll get more done if you take the time to incorporate their thinking into yours, and yours into theirs.
Don’t let your focus on results get in the way of caring about the people you work with. I made that mistake when I first got to Google. I was laser-focused on getting stuff done, and fast. That slowed me down in the end.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>人是核心，要真正关心每个人，尊重每个人的想法，找到比每个人想法更好的综合的想法。在没有确定团队状态的情况下，不要想着急着去做事。</p>
