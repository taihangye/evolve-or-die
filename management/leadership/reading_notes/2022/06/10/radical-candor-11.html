<p>这Ruinous Empathy是我比较容易陷入的一个陷阱，如果想要整个团队做出非常好的成绩，那就需要大部分甚至每个成员都很solid，但怎么让每个成员都很solid，一种是在招人的时候就严格把关，第二个就是把不适合的人帮他们找到更适合的公司内部、外部的机会，或者确实水平不行的人裁员。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The knowledge that you are about to inflict some measure of suffering on someone you may care a lot about obviously makes actually doing it very hard. I once talked to a crazy-successful New Yorker who seemed far more brash than compassionate about firing people. He told me that on mornings when he was going to fire somebody, he always woke up in a cold sweat. I hadn’t known that anything could make him sweat! If he felt bad, no wonder I did, and no wonder you do, too. So we avoid it at all costs—again, with negative consequences for everyone. So you need to approach firing thoughtfully and deliberately.
”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>作者也说了，对于她认为裁员不会有压力的人，也是很有压力的。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“How do you know when it’s time to fire somebody?”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Have you given Radically Candid guidance? Have you demonstrated to Peggy that you care personally about her work and her life, and have you been crystal clear when you have challenged her to improve? Has your praise been substantive and specific about what she has done right, rather than simply a salve to her ego? Have you been humble as well as direct in your criticism, offering to help her find solutions rather than attacking her as a person? And have you done these things on multiple occasions over the course of time? If the answer is yes and you have not seen improvement, or have seen only flickers of improvement, it’s time. Remember—the definition of insanity is continuing to do the same thing and expecting different results”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“How is this person’s poor performance affecting the rest of the team? Peggy’s shortcomings aren’t only your problem. As a manager, it’s your job to make sure you understand everyone else’s perspective, as well, and how her poor performance affects other members of the team”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Have you sought out a second opinion, spoken to someone whom you trust and with whom you can talk the problem through? Sometimes you may think you’ve been clear when you haven’t been. Getting an outside perspective can help you make sure you’re being fair. Also, if you don’t have experience firing somebody, talk to somebody who does. In today’s world, most companies have strict guidelines that must be followed when someone is being fired, and there are lots of legal “gotcha”s that can consume tons of time down the road if you’re not careful.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>怎么判断要不要才一个人？</p>
<ol>
  <li>有没有给过足够的radical candor，关心对方的情况，并给出足够的建议、表扬和指出缺点，如果一段时间内没有看到到达标准的表现，那就不应该继续做同样的事确期待不一样的结果。</li>
  <li>低绩效是否影响了整个组，和相关组</li>
  <li>问公司hr，法务或者有过裁员经验的朋友等等</li>
</ol>
