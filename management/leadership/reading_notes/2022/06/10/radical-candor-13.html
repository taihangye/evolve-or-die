Second, because even after making them I didn’t take the time to explain why or to persuade the team I’d made good decisions.

<p>manager不能就自己做个关系到整个组的决定，然后也不解释做决定的背景，以及让团队理解为什么这个决定有利于组的发展。你觉得是好的事，也是要让大家都理解</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Nobody’s always right,” I said.
“I didn’t say Steve is always right. I said he always gets it right. Like anyone, he is wrong sometimes, but he insists, and not gently either, that people tell him when he’s wrong, so he always gets it right in the end.”
”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Yes, and it was your job to convince me I was wrong,” Steve replied, “and you failed!” From then on, my colleague argued longer and more loudly, and he kept arguing until either he convinced Steve he was right or Steve convinced him he was wrong. Thus, Steve got it right by being willing to be wrong and by insisting that the people around him challenge him. There is no doubt that his style didn’t work for everyone. He hired people who were not afraid to argue with him, and then he pushed that fearlessness further.
Another colleague told me about an argument she’d had with Steve. She eventually persuaded him he was wrong, but then he so thoroughly adopted her position that it was as if it had been his all along. She speculated that Steve was so focused on getting to the right answer that he genuinely didn’t care who’d said what. Obviously, this approach could be frustrating—people want credit for their ideas. But the relentless focus on challenging himself and those around him to “get it” right rather than to “be” right was part of what drove Apple’s breathtaking ability to execute so well.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>没有人能够一直做对的决定，但要让团队都能够站出来指出错误在哪，然后去修正错误。但同时需要给提出反对意见的人足够的认可，让大家知道他提出了这个观点，也要让大家不要过于执着于谁提出了更好地方法，而是让目标能更好地实现。</p>
