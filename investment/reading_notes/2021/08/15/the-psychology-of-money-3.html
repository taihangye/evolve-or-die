</blockquote>

<p>用最重要的东西去换取不需要的东西，每个人都会觉得不合理，但大部分人又在这么做，或是不得不这么做。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The hardest financial skill is getting the goalpost to stop moving.”
“Modern capitalism is a pro at two things: generating wealth and generating envy. Perhaps they go hand in hand; wanting to surpass your peers can be the fuel of hard work. But life isn’t any fun without a sense of enough. Happiness, as it’s said, is just results minus expectations.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>最难的在于给自己设限。欲望是无穷尽的，即使是事先设限，如果没有想透彻，其实真正做到的那天也会觉得不够。Happiness, as it’s said, is just results minus expectations. 快乐就是结果减去期待值，说得真好。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Enough” is realizing that the opposite—an insatiable appetite for more—will push you to the point of regret.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>什么是足够了。足够了就是”拿到更多会让你后悔，因为你得到什么必须要失去一些东西“的反面。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There are many things never worth risking, no matter the potential gain.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>做人要有底线。有些东西失去了就永远拿不回来了。钱显然不是其中之一。</p>
