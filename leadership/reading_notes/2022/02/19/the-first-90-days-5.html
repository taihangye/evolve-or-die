  <p>“Julia failed because she did not make the leap from being a strong functional performer to taking on a cross-functional, project-leadership role. She failed to grasp that the strengths that had made her successful in marketing could be liabilities in a role that required her to lead without direct authority or superior expertise.

<p>过去的成功经验并不一定在环境发生变化时，再次带来成功。但人们往往又过于依赖那些成功的经验。我觉得学会和逆向学会都是很重要的事，要永远保持一个开放的头脑，去分析新的情况，而不是直接套用过去的经验。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“You also need to learn to strike the right balance between keeping the wide view and drilling down into the details. This juggling act can be challenging, because what had been the fifty-thousand-foot view in your previous role may be equivalent to the world at five thousand feet, or even five hundred feet, in your new job.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>平衡大局和细节也是很重要的一点。我目前感觉很难同时在两个方面同时做到100分，最终人的时间和精力都是有限的，要思考的是最重要的一件事是什么，如果对于当下来说是把控好细节，那就要明确和相关人员说对于大局的把控质量会下降，同时要不断的去问自己下一个当下最重要的是什么（和长远最重要的目标相比较和平衡）。老板的战术=你的战略，当你成为你老板的等级你原来的战略可能就只是战术了。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The complexity and ambiguity of the issues you are dealing with increase every time you get promoted. So you’ll need to rethink what you delegate. No matter where you land, the keys to effective delegation remain much the same: you build a team of competent people whom you trust, you establish goals and metrics to monitor their progress, you translate higher-level goals into specific responsibilities for your direct reports, and you reinforce them through process.
When you get promoted, however, what you delegate usually needs to change. If you’re leading an organization of five people, it may make sense to delegate specific tasks such as drafting a piece of marketing material or selling to a particular customer. In an organization of fifty people, your focus may shift from tasks to projects and processes. At five hundred people, you often need to delegate responsibility for specific products or platforms. And at five thousand people, your direct reports may be responsible for entire businesses.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>这里也强调了每一次升职，你需要思考的层面和复杂度就会发生变化。一个VP不可能天天想着某个代码怎么写，一个一线的manager也不可能天天想着怎么让工程部门的文化变得更好。同时在什么层面，需要你的直接下属做的事也不同，不能自己还停留在上个层面，抢了其实可以让团队得到锻炼的活，而忽略了你老板希望你开始做的新的活。</p>
