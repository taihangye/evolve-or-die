<meta name="description" content="“A baseline question you always should ask is, “How did we get to this point?” Otherwise, you risk tearing down existing structures or processes without knowing why they were put there in the first place. Armed with insight into the organization’s history, you may indeed decide that things need to change. Or you may find there is a good reason to leave it exactly where it is. A related learning block, as mentioned in the introduction, is the action imperative. The primary symptom is a nearly compulsive need to take action. Effective leaders strike the right balance between doing (making things happen) and being (observing and reflecting). But it is challenging, as Chris Hadley found, to let yourself “be” during transitions. And the pressure to “do” almost always comes more from inside the leader than from outside forces; it reflects a lack of confidence and a consequent need to prove yourself. Remember: simply displaying a genuine desire to learn and understand translates into increased credibility and influence.”" />

<p>在transition中都会有欲望去做一些改变来证明自己，但我们需要平衡“学习和反思历史”与“真正去改变和做事”之间的关联。最近组里有一个technical program manager在onboard，发现她就是属于很好地去学习组里的wiki和每个人沟通，并且看短期内有什么事是她可以有贡献的。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In the cultural domain, you must learn about norms, values, and behavioral expectations, which are almost certainly different from those in the organization you came from, even if you’re moving between units in the same company. In the political domain, you must understand the shadow organization—the informal set of processes and alliances that exist in the shadow of the formal structure and strongly influence how work actually gets done. The political domain is both important and difficult to understand, because it isn’t easily visible to those who have not spent time in the organization and because political land mines can easily stymie your efforts to establish a solid base of support during the transition.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>在transition过程中，如何学习大家的行为准则，比较重视什么方面，以及桌面下的组织结构，谁说话在什么方面有分量，得到谁的支持做某些方面的事最重要等等。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When you are diagnosing a new organization, start by meeting with your direct reports one-on-one. (This is an example of taking a horizontal slice across an organization by interviewing people at the same level in different functions.) Ask them essentially the same five questions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>What are the biggest challenges the organization is facing (or will face in the near future)?</li>
    <li>Why is the organization facing (or going to face) these challenges?</li>
    <li>What are the most promising unexploited opportunities for growth?</li>
    <li>What would need to happen for the organization to exploit the potential of these opportunities?</li>
    <li>If you were me, what would you focus attention on?
”
“These five questions, coupled with careful listening and thoughtful follow-up, are certain to elicit many insights; think of what Chris might have learned by using this approach. By asking everyone the same set of questions, you can identify prevalent and divergent views and thus avoid being swayed by the first or most forceful or articulate person you talk to. How people answer can also tell you a lot about your new team and its politics. Who answers directly, and who is evasive or prone to tangents? Who takes responsibility, and who points fingers? Who has a broad view of the business, and who seems stuck in a silo?”
“the point is that even a modest structure—a script and a sequence of interactions, such as meeting with people individually, doing some analysis, and then meeting with them together—can dramatically accelerate your ability to extract actionable insights”</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>单独和组员问同样的一组问题，去了解每个人的特点，以及组员之间的关系。然后把总结的内容通过组会再分享给整个组，并从中找出一些闪光点以及可以改善的点。</p>
