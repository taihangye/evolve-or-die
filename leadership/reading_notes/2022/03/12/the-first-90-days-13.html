  <p>“Negotiate time lines for diagnosis and action planning. Don’t let yourself get caught up immediately in firefighting or be pressured to make calls before you’re ready. Buy yourself some time, even if it’s only a few weeks, to diagnose the new organization and come up with an action plan.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>人们总是觉得一进新公司都要立马做一些重要决定，或者救火，但没有足够的上下文，不理解公司的文化，做事风格，首要的还是和老板商量好自己需要多久才能ramp up</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Pursue good marks from those whose opinions your boss respects. Your new boss’s opinion of you will be based in part on direct interactions and in part on what she hears about you from trusted others. Your boss will have preexisting relationships with people who are now your peers and possibly your subordinates. You needn’t curry favor with the people your boss trusts. Simply be alert to the multiple channels through which information and opinion about you will reach your boss.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>目前要转TLM就经历了类似的情况，老板会从我的peer以及相关的senior engineer来看他们对我转成经理有没有顾虑。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The situational diagnosis conversation. In this conversation, you seek to understand how your new boss sees the STARS portfolio you have inherited. Are there elements of start-up, turnaround, accelerated growth, realignment, and sustaining success? How did the organization reach this point? What factors—both soft and hard—make this situation a challenge? What resources within the organization can you draw on? Your view may differ from your boss’s, but it is essential to grasp how she sees the situation.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The expectations conversation. Your goal in this conversation is to understand and negotiate expectations. What does your new boss need you to do in the short term and in the medium term? What will constitute success? Critically, how will your performance be measured? When? You might conclude that your boss’s expectations are unrealistic and that you need to work to reset them. Also, as part of your broader campaign to secure early wins, discussed in the next chapter, keep in mind that it’s better to underpromise and overdeliver.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The resource conversation. This conversation is essentially a negotiation for critical resources. What do you need to be successful? What do you need your boss to do? The resources need not be limited to funding or personnel. In a realignment, for example, you may need help from your boss to persuade the organization to confront the need for change. Key here is to focus your boss on the benefits and costs of what you can accomplish with different amounts of resources.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The style conversation. This conversation is about how you and your new boss can best interact on an ongoing basis. What forms of communication does he prefer, and for what? Face-to-face? Voice, electronic? How often? What kinds of decisions does he want to be consulted on, and when can you make the call on your own? How do your styles differ, and what are the implications for the ways you should interact?”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The personal development conversation. Once you’re a few months into your new role, you can begin to discuss how you’re doing and what your developmental priorities should be. Where are you doing well? In what areas do you need to improve or do things differently? Are there projects or special assignments you could undertake (without sacrificing focus)?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>五个重要的对话：理解现状，校准期待，探讨资源，适配风格，着眼发展。对于从组织内部成长起来的人，其实也要有这些对话，因为本身就比较熟悉，但还是需要和老板有正式地讨论，让大家的想法同步。</p>
