Performance in a realignment may be better than expected, but still poor. Or it may be that nothing much seems to happen, because a crisis was avoided.

Success may consist of a small loss of market share in the face of a concerted attack by competitors or the eking out of a few percentage points of top-line growth in a mature business. The unknown in both realignments and sustaining-success situations is what would have happened if other actions had been taken or other people had been in charge—the “as compared to what?” problem.

<p>STARS模型是指组织、公司所处的状态：start-up，turn-around, accelarated growth, realignment, sustain-success. 在重定位和维持成功这两种状态是比较难评价一个领导者的成功和失败的。因为这两种状态下，企业相对都是在比较好的状态里的，如果是维持现状感觉就是领导者也没做什么，大家会觉得这是理所当然的，而想要提高或者让大家意识到危机又不是件容易的事。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“A key implication is that success in transitioning depends, in no small measure, on your ability to transform the prevailing organizational psychology in predictable ways. In start-ups, the prevailing mood is often one of excited confusion, and your job is to channel that energy into productive directions, in part by deciding what not to do. In turnarounds, you may be dealing with a group of people who are close to despair; it is your job to provide them with a concrete plan for moving forward and confidence that it will improve the situation. In accelerated-growth situations, you need to help people understand that the organization needs to be more disciplined and get them to work within defined processes and systems. In realignments, you will likely have to pierce the veil of denial that is preventing people from confronting the need to reinvent the business. Finally, in sustaining-success situations, you must invent the challenge by finding ways to keep people motivated, combat complacency, and find new direction for growth—both organizational and personal.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>这里很好地描述了，当你在到了不同STARS的情况中，让大家能意识到什么是最重要的是一个transition成功与否的标准。对于start-ups，大家容易对很多新的点很兴奋，你要做的是更好地把这种情绪导向更有价值的方向，并对一些事说不。在turnaround中，大家都是很绝望、焦虑的，提供一个很具体的执行计划让大家一起努力重拾信心。在accelerated-growth中，不能再像startups一样野蛮生长，需要建立一些流程和制度，让大家做事更有条理。在realignment中，让大家意思到自己拒绝承认问题所在，并且直面这些问题来迎接新的挑战。在sustaining-success里，需要去创造新的挑战来激励大家。</p>
